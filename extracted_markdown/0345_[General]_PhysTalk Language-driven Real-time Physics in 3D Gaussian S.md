Figure 1. PhysTalk takes as input a natural language prompt together with a 3DGS scene and produces physically consistent 4D animations
(first row). The efficiency of the pipeline enables rapid iteration, on the fly refinement (second row), and interactive manipulation of
simulated behavior (yellow arrows in third row’s samples indicate the user’s push direction).
Abstract
Realistic visual simulations are omnipresent, yet their cre-
ation requires computing time, rendering, and expert ani-
mation knowledge. Open-vocabulary visual effects genera-
tion from text inputs emerges as a promising solution that
can unlock immense creative potential. However, current
pipelines lack both physical realism and effective language
interfaces, requiring slow offline optimization. In contrast,
PhysTalk takes a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene as
input and translates arbitrary user prompts into real time,
physics based, interactive 4D animations. A large language
model (LLM) generates executable code that directly modi-
fies 3DGS parameters through lightweight proxies and par-
ticle dynamics. Notably, PhysTalk is the first framework to
couple 3DGS directly with a physics simulator without re-
lying on time consuming mesh extraction. While remaining
open vocabulary, this design enables interactive 3D Gaus-
sian animation via collision aware, physics based manipu-
lation of arbitrary, multi material objects. Finally, PhysTalk
is train-free and computationally lightweight: this makes
4D animation broadly accessible and shifts these workflows
from a “render and wait” paradigm toward an interactive
dialogue with a modern, physics-informed pipeline.

1. Introduction
Visual content creators increasingly seek tools to animate
arbitrary 3D objects in a scalable, controllable, and phys-
ically realistic way.
Traditional CGI pipelines require
painstaking manual rigging, skeletal joints, or bespoke
mesh deformation setups. They are bottlenecks in modern
production. Moreover, manually authoring physically re-
alistic motion, such as a vase falling and deforming on a
table, requires expert simulation knowledge. Meanwhile,
the emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revo-
lutionized static scene representation, but bringing the ad-
vantages of its photorealism to life with dynamic, plausible
motion remains a major open challenge. The ideal system
would allow a user to simply describe a desired effect such
as “make the vase jump up and fall back” and see it executed
instantly and realistically.
Current approaches are fundamentally divided, forcing a
trade-off between creative control and physical realism. On
one side, text-driven methods [16, 20, 30] offer impressive
open-vocabulary control. They can manipulate Gaussian at-
tributes directly from a prompt, but ignore physics. The
resulting motion is often “floaty” or nonsensical, lacking
gravity, collisions, and material properties, failing the test
of realism. On the other side, physics-integrated Gaussians
[11, 31] achieve stunning, realistic dynamics like fracturing

“Drop a vase from 1 meter: upper 40% is elastic, while the remaining lower part is rigid.”
“Make the bear statue float under moon gravity.”
Figure 2. PhysTalk enables a wide range of physical behaviors via Text-to-Physics Translation. The first row shows a vase with elastic and
rigid regions reacting differently when dropped: while the vase remains rigid, the impact force is transferred to the elastic flowers, which
begin to wobble. The second row illustrates altered object motion under lunar gravity.
and fluid flow. However, they lack a high-level creative in-
terface. Scenarios must be hard-coded by experts, prevent-
ing open-vocabulary control, editability, and interactivity.
This “great divide” leaves a critical gap: no single system
provides both intuitive control and physical guarantees.
We posit that this trade-off is unnecessary. Our solu-
tion is not to force a generative model to learn the laws
of physics, but to make it speak the language of physics.
We introduce PhysTalk, a novel framework that bridges
this gap by reframing the task as Text-to-Physics Trans-
lation. Our key insight is to leverage a Large-Language
Model (LLM) as an intelligent “compiler” that translates
high-level, natural language intent directly into executable,
low-level code for a dedicated, high-performance physics
engine such as Genesis [3].
Our pipeline is direct, fast, and object-agnostic. Given
a prompt (e.g., “make the vase jump and fall back to the
table”), our LLM generates code for the physics simulator.
To connect the 3DGS representation to the engine without a
complex mesh, we instantly construct a lightweight convex
hull proxy from the object’s Gaussian centers. The LLM-
generated code then instructs the engine to run the simula-
tion using the appropriate material model (e.g., rigid, elas-
tic, or fluid). Finally, a skinning routine transfers the simu-
lated motion of the physics particles back to the individual
Gaussians. Because this entire process is GPU-accelerated
and lightweight, the simulation runs in real-time, allow-
ing users to edit the animation, change the camera view-
point or interactively apply new forces to the object and
see the physical response immediately (Fig. 1). Also, as
we leverage an efficient physics engine to simulate motion,
PhysTalk has wide rage of capabilities ranging from simula-
tions of various object materials’ physical properties to sim-
ulating multi-material objects or altering gravity, as shown
in Fig. 2.
This “Text-to-Physics” approach allows PhysTalk to
uniquely satisfy all the key desiderata for a modern anima-
tion system:
• Realism: Motion is driven by a state-of-the-art physics
engine, guaranteeing adherence to gravity, collisions, and
material behaviors.
• Open-Vocabulary Simulation: By translating free-form
text into simulation code and automatically generating
proxies from Gaussian centers, PhysTalk generalizes to
arbitrary prompts and objects, eliminating the need for
canned effect libraries or manual rigging.
• Interactive Physics & Editability: Unlike slow, mesh-
based pipelines [16], our GPU-accelerated framework
runs in real-time, transforming animation into an active
process. Users can iterate implicitly by re-prompting, ex-
plicitly by tweaking the generated physics code, or inter-
actively by applying forces (e.g. pushing objects or letting
them fall) with immediate visual feedback.
• Multi-material Support:
Our pipeline introduces a
novel hybrid coupling, enabling a single object to be sim-
ulated with heterogeneous properties from one prompt.
By unifying high-level language intent with low-level,
interactive physics, PhysTalk transforms 3D animation
from a “render and wait” process into a truly “hands-on”
creative experience.
2. Related Work
Our work lies at the intersection of physics-integrated 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and language-driven 3D anima-
tion. While recent efforts have explored these directions
separately, their integration remains limited. We argue that
PhysTalk is the first framework to provide a truly expres-
sive and interactive language interface for directing physics,
rather than merely assigning material properties.

2.1. Physics-Integrated Gaussian Dynamics
To enhance realism in 3DGS, several recent methods inte-
grate Gaussian Splatting with physical properties [18, 25].
These approaches treat Gaussians as the medium for simu-
lation, enabling physically grounded scene dynamics. Phys-
Gaussian [31] pioneered this direction by modeling each
Gaussian as a material point within a continuum mechan-
ics framework (MPM), achieving realistic deformations
and fractures. Similarly, Gaussian Splashing [11] coupled
position-based dynamics with 3DGS to simulate rigid-body
and fluid interactions. While these methods achieve high
physical fidelity, their interfaces rely on graphical user in-
teraction, where physical behaviors are manually defined.
Feature Splatting [26] advanced this line of work by intro-
ducing predefined editing scripts and embedding rich se-
mantic features (e.g., CLIP [8, 27], DINO [24]) directly into
Gaussians. This allows users to select objects via text (e.g.,
“the vase”) and assign material properties (e.g., “make it
rigid”). However, its use of language is fundamentally pas-
sive: it supports property labeling and segmentation (“what
is this object made of?”) but cannot express dynamic events
or causal interactions.
In summary, while physics-integrated 3DGS methods
achieve impressive realism, they lack a high-level creative
interface. Motions and interactions must be pre-scripted,
requiring expert knowledge of simulation parameters. In
contrast, PhysTalk introduces a new, active paradigm. Our
Text-to-Physics Translation interprets natural language as
executable physics code, enabling users to freely describe
complex, event-driven scenarios. This shifts the field be-
yond material assignment toward true, language-based di-
rection and interactivity.
2.2. Language-Driven VFX and Animation
In parallel, several works have explored language as a
control interface for 3D scene editing [6, 7] and anima-
tion [10, 14, 29]. Leveraging the rapid progress of LLM-
based code generation [2, 9], recent studies have applied
these ideas in computer vision [12, 13, 17, 23] and robotics
[28, 32], showing that language can act as a generative in-
terface for scene understanding and control. The most di-
rect approach, PromptVFX [20], bypasses physics entirely
by using an LLM to generate flow fields that deform Gaus-
sian centers according to textual prompts. While fast and
open-vocabulary, the resulting motions often lack physi-
cal realism. AutoVFX [16] improves realism by producing
Blender [5] scripts that invoke Blender’s built-in physics en-
gine. However, this comes at the cost of expensive mesh ex-
traction and offline rendering, limiting responsiveness and
interactivity.
PhysTalk builds upon the text-to-code paradigm but de-
parts from mesh-based pipelines.
By targeting a GPU-
accelerated simulation framework our approach achieves
real-time interactivity, object-agnostic operation, and phys-
ically consistent behavior. In doing so, it unifies the seman-
tic flexibility of language-based control with the realism of
physics-integrated 3D Gaussian Splatting.
3. Methodology
3D Gaussian Splatting. 3DGS models a scene as a set of
anisotropic Gaussian primitives [19]. Each Gaussian i is
defined by a center (position) ci ∈R3, a covariance matrix
Σi ∈R3×3, a color Ci, and an opacity αi. The covariance
Σi is parameterized by a rotation quaternion ri (represent-
ing Ri ∈SO(3)) and a scale vector si (representing Si),
resulting in:
Σi = RiSiS⊤
i R⊤
i
(1)
A 2D-projected covariance Σ′
i is computed via a view-
ing transform W and projection Jacobian J as Σ′
i
=
JWΣiW ⊤J⊤[33]. The color of any pixel for N overlap-
ping splats is then rendered via front-to-back alpha blend-
ing: C
=
P
i∈N ci αi
Qi−1
j=1
 1 −αj

, where ci and αi
denote the color and opacity derived from the Gaussian pa-
rameters.
Unified Physics Simulation. To support open-vocabulary
prompts ranging from “push” to “melt,” our framework re-
lies on Genesis [3], a multi-physics backend capable of
simulating rigid bodies, elastic materials (MPM), and flu-
ids (SPH) within a unified domain. Crucially, to drive the
Gaussian skinning described in Sec. 3.3, the engine must
provide access to the full deformation gradient F (t)
i
∈R3×3
for each particle i at every time step t. This tensor implicitly
captures the local rotation and stretch components required
to realistically deform anisotropic 3D Gaussian primitives,
independent of the specific underlying solver.
3.1. Pipeline Overview
Our PhysTalk pipeline transforms a static 3DGS object into
a physically-plausible animation, guided entirely by a natu-
ral language prompt. PhysTalk operates on a pre-segmented
set of Gaussians corresponding to the target object, obtained
either manually or through external automatic segmenta-
tion. As shown in Fig. 3, our process is training-free and
consists of three main stages:
1. Text-to-Physics Translation:
PhysTalk leverages an
LLM to convert the user’s prompt into executable Python
code for the Genesis physics engine.
2. Physics Simulation:
the generated code creates a
lightweight proxy (a convex hull) from the 3DGS cen-
ters and runs the physics simulation, recording particle
trajectories p(t)
i
and deformation gradients F (t)
i
.
3. Gaussian Skinning:
a lightweight skinning routine
transfers the simulated particle motion back to the orig-
inal Gaussians, updating their centers c(t)
j
and covari-
ances Σ(t)
j
for each frame to produce the final animation.

Text-to-Physics Translation. The text signals are fed to an LLM, which generates code for a physical simulation of the scene object.
Physics Simulation. We run the simulation and record, per frame, particle motions (black dots) and deformations (black arrows). Skinning
For each Gaussian (red circle), we select K neighboring particles and their deformation gradients (red points and arrows), then apply
inverse-distance blending to obtain the Gaussian’s motion and deformation; this is repeated for all Gaussians. Output. The pipeline outputs
a physics-based 4D Gaussian animation conditioned on the object and prompt.
Finally, opacity and color changes can be efficiently synthe-
sized and applied by leveraging [20].
3.2. Text-to-Physics Translation
The central component of our approach is the Text-to-
Physics Translation module, responsible for converting nat-
ural language prompts into executable simulator code. Be-
cause current large language models (LLMs) are not trained
on specific simulators such as Genesis [3] and thus cannot
natively produce syntactically or semantically valid code for
it, we employ an in-context learning (ICL) framework to
steer the model toward simulator-compliant outputs.
1. Constrained Prompting. We do not ask the LLM to
generate code from scratch. Instead, we provide it with
a structured simulation template that it must fill in. This
template defines the necessary functions: a build_scene
function that computes the object’s convex hull, instanti-
ates the scene and object(s) with selected material(s), and
sets simulation parameters; a step method that advances
physics, samples current particle positions and per particle
deformations, and stores them in a buffer; and a query
method that concatenates the buffered samples and per-
forms skinning. This constrained approach dramatically im-
proves output reliability by forcing the LLM to focus on
parameter selection (e.g., material type, forces) rather than
code structure.
2. Few-Shot Exemplars. We provide the LLM with the
official physics engine API specifications and a small set
of hand-written simulation functions as few-shot exemplars.
These examples allow the LLM to condition the generation
with the correct syntax and common patterns.
3. Custom API and Instruction. Additionally, we expose
a small API suite for deformation estimation and particle-
to-Gaussian motion skinning that the model can invoke.
This is a crucial design choice: the LLM does not need
to know how to perform SVD or k-d tree skinning; it only
needs to call our pre-defined functions. This setup allows to
steer the LLM to produce executable simulation code that
is both complex and correct. Finally, we engineer a set of
text instruction to guide the model to produce effects, pro-
vide executable code and avoid instable physical setups. We
report exemplars and instructions in the Supplementary Ma-
terial.
3.3. Physics Simulation and Skinning
Proxy Generation. Our pipeline is object-agnostic as any
generated simulation’s code can be applied to any object.
Given a 3DGS object G, we approximate the object by
wrapping its points with a lightweight convex hull derived
from its Gaussian centers cj. This proxy is coarse enough
to keep setup and simulation fast, yet expressive enough to
support accurate physics.
Simulation. The LLM-generated build_scene function
instantiates this convex hull in the simulator, discretizes it
into N simulation particles P(t=0) = {p(t=0)
i
}N
i=1, and as-
signs the chosen material properties. The step function
then runs the simulation, recording the world-space dis-

and the per-particle deforma-
tion gradient F(t)
i
∈R3×3 for each particle at each frame.
This gradient F(t)

fully describes the local deformation, as
motivated by its Singular Value Decomposition (SVD):

= diag(s(t)

i,3).
This decomposition allows the rotation and stretch compo-
nents to be represented respectively as:

S(t)
i
= V(t)

Gaussian Skinning.
To transfer this motion to the Gaus-
sians, we first associate each Gaussian gj with a fixed set of
K nearby particles Nj based on a k-d tree query at the rest
pose. We then compute the skinning weights wj,i for each
neighbor particle i ∈Nj based on their inverse distance at
the rest pose, ensuring P
i∈Nj wj,i = 1:
wj,i =
 ∥cj −p(0)
i ∥2
2 + ϵ
−1
P
k∈Nj
 ∥cj −p(0)
k ∥2
2 + ϵ
−1
(4)
where cj is the Gaussian center, p(0)
i
is the particle rest po-
sition, and ϵ is a small constant for numerical stability.
For every step t, the query function updates the Gaus-
sian center ˆc(t)
j
by adding a weighted sum of its neighbors’
displacements to its original center cj:
ˆc(t)
j
= cj +
X
i∈Nj
wj,id(t)
i
(5)
Similarly, the effective deformation gradient for the Gaus-
sian, ˆF(t)
j , is a weighted sum of the particle deformation
gradients:
ˆF(t)
j
=
X
i∈Nj
wj,iF(t)
i
(6)
This blended deformation gradient ˆF(t)
j
implicitly averages
the local rotations Ri and stretches Si from the particle
neighborhood. We apply this transformation directly to the
original Gaussian covariance Σj using the standard trans-
formation:
ˆΣ(t)
j
= ˆF(t)
j Σj(ˆF(t)
j )⊤
(7)
This lightweight, parallelizable process “skins" the physical
simulation onto the 3DGS object, ultimately producing a
realistic, dynamic animation.
Generalization to Continuum Materials. To generalize
animation to fluids, we leverage smoothed-particle hydro-
dynamics (SPH) descriptions without per-particle deforma-
tion gradient by setting ˆFj = I. Note that, as flow ex-
pands on a surface, isolated Gaussians can drift apart and
visible gaps can emerge.
We address this by detection
of holes whenever inter-Gaussian spacing increases signif-
icantly. For each hole, we spawn new Gaussian centers on
multiple radial shells if a Poisson-disk distance test is satis-
fied. This targeted insertion fills gaps and maintains visual
continuity even for fluid streams. We ablate this approach
in the Supplementary Material.
4. Experiments
4.1. Experimental Details
Physics Engine. We instantiate our framework using Gen-
esis [3], an open-source, GPU-accelerated physics engine
selected for its high performance and flexible Python API.
Genesis supports rigid objects, continuum materials, and
particle-based fluids in a single environment.
Dataset & Preprocessing. We evaluate our method on four
real-world scenes: the garden vase and bulldozer scenes
from Mip-NeRF360 [4], the bear scene from Instruct-
NeRF2NeRF [15], and the horse scene extracted from
Tanks and Temples [21]. These scenes are reconstructed
using Gaussian Splatting, yielding a set of 3D Gaussians
that jointly encode the geometry and color of the scene and
its objects.
Baselines. We compare our approach against three base-
lines that generate 4D Gaussians from text. In particular,
we consider Gaussians2Life [30], which uses a text con-
ditioned video diffusion model to synthesize a 2D motion
that is subsequently lifted to 4D Gaussians via an offline
optimization stage. Also, we employ AutoVFX [16], which
translates prompts into Blender scripts, converts the 3DGS
object into a mesh, run the computation and then renders
the result: this requires expensive mesh extraction and of-
fline rendering. Both pipelines involve heavy preprocessing
and do not support user interaction or editing. In addition,
we employ PromptVFX [20], which applies LLM gener-
ated transformation fields directly to Gaussians in real time,
providing fast text control at the cost of sacrificing explicit
physical grounding.
Implementation Notes.
Our method is implemented in
PyTorch and uses GPT-5 [1] to translate text prompts into
Genesis simulation code. All experiments are run on a sin-
gle NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU, although we observed that
the simulation consistently uses under 4 GB of VRAM, en-
abling the method to run on consumer-grade GPUs as well.
We use K = 8 nearest simulation particles per Gaussian
when applying the skinning procedure described in Sec. 3.3.
4.2. Qualitative Evaluation
In Fig. 4 we qualitatively compare all baselines and
PhysTalk on a set of three prompts. For each prompt, our
pipeline generates animations by updating Gaussian param-
eters according to the simulation.

Elastic Jump.
For this prompt, PhysTalk correctly at-
tributes elastic behavior to the vase and deforms it after
impact. Contrarily, PromptVFX and AutoVFX both pro-
duce essentially rigid vases, with PromptVFX generating
an unrealistically jump and AutoVFX producing a mostly
ballistic fall with no visible deformation. Gaussians2Life
manages to trigger a small jump but introduces noticeable
non-physical distortions of the vase geometry.
Push Forward. Both PhysTalk and PromptVFX produce
plausible and visually coherent pushing motions, while
Gaussians2Life fails to generate a meaningful interaction.
AutoVFX is omitted from this comparison as for this
prompt it yields a static result with no motion.
Lava Flow.
This prompt tests fluid style dynamics.
PhysTalk generates a lava stream that remains dense and
flows smoothly over the scene, capturing coherent fluid mo-
tion while dripping down from the pedestal. In contrast,
AutoVFX produces a sparse, low density violet fluid that
lacks the appearance of molten lava. PromptVFX yields a
lava like material whose motion is not consistent with real-
istic fluid dynamics. Gaussians2Life relies on 2D diffusion
based flow fields lifted to 4D Gaussians for object deforma-
tion and does not support particle based or fluid like mo-
tion. Thus, it is unable to produce a meaningful result for
this prompt.
4.3. Quantitative Evaluation
Metrics. Benchmarking 4D Gaussian animation is chal-
lenging, since no ground truth sequences are available. Fol-
lowing recent work [6, 16, 20, 30], we report CLIP sim-
ilarity [27] as a proxy for text to single-image alignment.
However, CLIP is computed at the frame level, so it does
not capture motion quality, physical realism, or text ani-
mation coherence, all aspects that can only be appreciated
when viewing the animation over time [20]. To better ac-
count for video level consistency, we follow [20] and ad-
ditionally report the VQAScore [22], a video based metric
that has been shown to correlate more strongly with human

judgment. The VQAScore estimates the probability that a
vision language model answers “Yes” to the question Does
this video align with the described animation: ‘{prompt}”?,
denoted as P(‘Yes” | video, prompt).
As a complement to these metrics we also conduct a user
study to assess the perceived quality of the generated anima-
tions. We collect preferences from 50 human evaluators and
follow the protocol introduced by [16], asking participants
to rate each sample along two dimensions, Text Alignment
and Animation Quality. Ratings are given on a 1–5 Likert
scale and subsequently normalized to the range [0, 1] using
min-max normalization.
Finally, since our goal is to design a low-latency pipeline
that can be effectively used for iterative editing and inter-
action, we report runtimes for all compared methods. For
fluid simulations we additionally report PhysTalk runtime
both with and without the hole filling strategy described in
Sec. 3.3.
Results.
Table 1 shows that PhysTalk consistently out-
performs all other methods across all prompts in terms of
VQAScore, while CLIP similarity remains inconclusive.
Moreover, the user study indicates that human evaluators
systematically prefer PhysTalk, with perceived cumulative
quality improvements of 28% in Text Alignment and 22% in
Animation Quality over the best competitor, PromptVFX.
Note that PhysTalk achieves runtimes that are compara-
ble with the fastest competitor, PromptVFX, despite pro-

ducing physically realistic, simulation-based outputs.
In
contrast, Gaussian2Life and, in particular, AutoVFX are
much slower, with runtimes on the order of minutes rather
than seconds.
4.4. Editability & Interaction
We design our framework to be fast and efficient, enabling
users to refine a simulation until they are satisfied with the
result. These edits can occur either implicitly, by asking
the LLM for refinements, or explicitly, by tuning simula-
tion variables. We showcase implicit edits in Fig. 1, where
the user starts from an elastic-vase jumping simulation and
iteratively modifies its behavior. Also, we illustrate explicit
simulation’s parameter editing: in Fig. 5a the user increases
the surface-tension parameter to obtain a visually denser
flow compared to the original sample in Fig. 5b.
In addition, our pipeline allows users to create simula-
tions with specific physical behavior and interact with them
at runtime in the browser. Fig. 6 shows a user dragging and
pushing an object, first upward and then sideways, while it
remains subject to the residual forces and deformations ap-
plied throughout the animation. The interaction speed de-
pends on the number of Gaussians and the chosen material,
with observed interactive frame rates between 4 and 9 FPS.
5. Discussion & Limitations
While our in-context learning strategy effectively constrains
the LLM to the correct API syntax, the inherent stochas-
ticity of foundation models means that code generation is
not deterministic. In rare instances, the model may hal-
lucinate non-existent functions, necessitating a regenera-
tion step, especially when requests drastically diverge from
provided documentation. Additionally, like many particle-
based solvers, the underlying physics engine can exhibit nu-
merical instability when subject to extreme physical param-
eters (e.g., excessively high stiffness or velocity). Finally,
our current use of convex hull proxies, while highly effi-
cient for real-time interaction, limits the simulation fidelity
for objects with deep concavities or complex topology.
6. Conclusion
We introduced PhysTalk, a text-to-physics framework that
resolves the longstanding divide between open-vocabulary
language control and physically grounded 3D Gaussian an-
imation. By translating natural language prompts into ex-
ecutable code for an efficient physics engine, our approach
sidesteps the limitations of text-driven Gaussian manipula-
tion methods, namely the lack of physical grounding and the
rigidity of hand-authored simulation setups. Experiments
across diverse scenes and prompts show that PhysTalk
achieves higher perceptual alignment, better motion qual-
ity, and greater realism than competitors, while operat-
ing at runtimes that support interactivity and iterative edit-
ing. This paradigm opens a promising path toward general,
physically plausible, and authorable 3DGS animation tools.
We believe that this paves the way to future works exploring
richer scene-level interactions, more complex multi-object
dynamics, and broader extensions of physics-based 3DGS
animation.

PhysTalk: Language-driven Real-time Physics in 3D Gaussian Scenes
Supplementary Material
7. Video Supplementary Material
We encourage readers to watch the accompanying video re-
sults, as we focus on the temporal animation of Gaussians,
which is best appreciated in motion. In particular:
(1) we include a comparison between baselines and
PhysTalk on all prompts evaluated in Fig. 4. This allows one
to appreciate the elastic dynamics produced by PhysTalk
and its behavior when generating dense lava flows;
(2) we show the additional qualitative results provided in
Fig. 2. These highlight the reduced moon gravity and the
behavior of multimaterial objects, where the rigid part re-
mains undeformed while transferring impact forces to the
elastic part, which then wobbles;
(3) we assess the fluid dynamic behavior with and without
the hole filling strategy described in Sec. 3.3: when hole fill-
ing is active, the lava appears denser and forms a continuous
stream, rather than showing visible gaps;
(4) we illustrate both the simulation capabilities of our
pipeline and its editability by reusing simulations from
Fig. 4 and varying their physical parameters: we tune both
the Young’s modulus E, which controls objects’ elasticity,
and the parameter γ, that is the surface tension, which con-
trols the spread of the lava;
(5) we show a user interacting with both the vase and the
bulldozer scenes. Here yellow arrows point in the direction
of the force applied by the user. Also, forces are propor-
tional to the coordinate system’s displacement. Notably, ob-
jects react to pushes and gravity, while respecting the elastic
material properties chosen in the simulation.
8. Simulation Grounding
In this Supplementary Material we provide the complete
simulation grounding documents.
Few-Shot Exemplars. We constrain the LLM to generate
executable Genesis code using a small set of hand-written
few-shot exemplars, described below.
rigid.py: this simulation describes how to simulate a
rigid body falling. This is not trivial, as unlike elastic, liq-
uid, muscle materials, rigid bodies in Genesis do not lever-
age a particle system. This prevents us from directly ob-
taining the data required to skin the simulated motion back
to the Gaussians described in Sec. 3.3. Hence, the rigid
object’s motion is transferred to a set of evenly distributed
particles that we spawn inside the simulated convex hull.
turnToWater.py: this describes how to turn an object into
a very sparse fluid that quickly spreads over a flat surface.
multimaterial.py:
this simulation describes how to
construct an object with an elastic bottom part and a rigid
top part. This is crucial as Genesis does not natively support
these objects. We contribute a procedure to create them, and
it is essential to instruct the LLM on how to use it.
drop.py: this simulation describes how to drop an object
and make it fracture at impact into fragments that are ap-
proximated as sand-like particles.
APIs. In common.py we provide the LLM with a set of
functions for recurring operations, including:
getConvexHull: this function provides an easy and effi-
cient interface to create watertight convex hull meshes from
Gaussian centers.
get_rot: this function allows the LLM to pass a Genesis
entity and obtain its deformation gradient F. In the case of
fluids, for which the deformation gradient is not defined, it
returns the identity matrix I.
deform_centers_and_rot:
this function computes a
mapping between simulation particles at rest position and
the original object’s Gaussian centers. The mapping is com-
puted at the first invocation and then cached. For each Gaus-
sian it selects K neighboring particles and their deformation
gradients, then applies inverse-distance blending to obtain
the Gaussian’s motion and deformation.
Instructions. In Fig. 7–9 we report the instruction used to
steer the LLM toward generating valid Genesis simulation
code. These instructions have been tuned to be sufficiently
general while fostering reproducibility of the qualitative re-
sults provided in the main paper.
9. Additional Details
Finally, we report some additional details about our
pipeline. While in our experiments we use GPT-5 as the
LLM and Genesis as the physics engine, we emphasize that
the overall design is modular and these components could
be replaced with any retrieval augmented LLM and any par-
ticle based physics engine. For instance, although we cur-
rently manually fit a box and a ground plane under the horse
to sustain the lava flow, one could incorporate a scene seg-
mentation module that automatically provides a semantic
and geometric description of the scene. We also instruct the
model to default to an elastic material when not otherwise
specified, since elastic motion is easier to appreciate than
rigid motion in sequences of static images. Also, as the
LLM is a generative model, it may produce different sim-
ulations for the same prompt. Finally, before creating the
convex hull, we prune Gaussians that have few neighbors
within a local spherical neighborhood. This step is crucial,
since outliers due to imperfect reconstruction can lead to
distorted convex hulls and degraded physics simulations.

Generate simulate functions or a Simulation class for Genesis-AI that animate elements using physics. Always rely
on the provided documentation, user guide, API guide, and example files. Do not invent APIs.
Rules
1) Use official APIs only. Before calling any function, verify it exists and confirm its signature, parameter
names, types, and return values in the provided documentation and examples. Always read the documentation.
2) No hallucinations. If an operation is not supported by Genesis or not present in the examples, do not use it.
3) Physically plausible setups. Default to real-world behavior, including gravity and contact, unless the prompt
clearly implies otherwise.
4) Never re-define, alter, or re-implement anything from common.py, especially shutdownGS, deform_object,
deform_centers_and_rot, get_rot, getConvexHull.
6) Provide code in a code-box so that it can be easily copied and pasted
7) Be sure that the physical parameters (rho, dt, viscosity etc...) are not too high, otherwise the simulation
will explode.
8) Do not use "very thin clearance to avoid initial interpenetration"
9) No cameras
Required File Header (exact)
At the very top of every generated simulation function or Simulation class, emit this header verbatim, replacing [
PROMPT] with the user’s prompt:
#Prompt: [PROMPT]
import genesis as gs
import numpy as np
from math import floor
import torch
from .common import shutdownGS, deform_centers_and_rot, get_rot, getConvexHull
Class Signature & Public API
- Never change this constructor signature:
class Simulation():
def __init__(self, pts=None, fps=50, s=5, use_birdal_quat=True, use_convex_hull=True):
- Always include these public methods with the same names and roles:
step(n_substeps=1): advance the simulation, sample exactly one frame per step() call.
query(clear=True): return deformed centers and F_deform up to now, then clear buffers when clear is True.
shutdown(): call shutdownGS(self.scene).
- Sampling buffers:
Maintain self.positions and self.F_deform lists.
When exporting accumulated data inside query, you must concatenate with these exact lines, do not change them:
simulations = np.concatenate(positions, axis=0)
F_deform = np.concatenate(F_deform,axis=0)
- always use a self._build_scene() where you do gs.init(backend=gs.gpu) and the set up the scene
- notice that in gs.morphs.Mesh(file=value ...) the value must be string, not posix path
Data Collection Details
- Do not write positions.append(mpm_sand_box.get_particles()).
- Use this pattern to read particle positions from MPM or SPH entities:
positions.append(mpm_elm.solver.particles.to_numpy()[’pos’].copy()[0].squeeze(1))
or the equivalent shape-correct version already used in the examples.
Ground Plane and Initial Placement
- Every simulation must spawn a ground plane under the object at its original pose, and the object’s bounding box
must be aligned to this pose.
- If asked to start the box from a different pose, adjust after the ground plane is created and before the box is
instantiated. For example, to raise by 1 m:
pos[2] += 1
pts[:, 2] += 1
cube = scene.add_entity(
morph = gs.morphs.Box(pos=pos, size=size),
Figure 7. Instructions (lines 1-50)
2

<!-- page 13 -->
)
The plane is always:
self.scene.add_entity(
gs.morphs.Plane(pos=(pos[0], pos[1], plane_z)),
gs.materials.Rigid(friction=.15),
gs.surfaces.Rough(color=(.25,.25,.25)))
If asked to float or apply an initlial force or push in direction x to the object you can use elastic entity and
do:
self.scene.build()
vel = torch.zeros((self.cube.n_particles, 3), dtype=torch.float32)
vel[:, x] = some_value
self.cube.set_velocity(vel)
Velocity values around 5 are very strong forces. 4 is good.
Do not use undocumented DOF-velocity controls for a free rigid.
Materials, Stability, and Samplers
- Choose materials reflecting prompt and remain numerically stable. Avoid extreme densities, stiffness, or
particle sizes that cause explosions or collapse.
- For SPH liquids valid samplers are: regular, pbs, pbs-sdf_res. Do not use poisson for gs.materials.SPH.Liquid.
- Use conservative dt, substeps, particle size, and friction to avoid instability. Prefer parameters demonstrated
in the example files.
- The maximum mu is 0.17, don’t use higher values.
- Very dense fluids are controlled by gamma and have gamma = 0.4.
- If asked for elastic materials use gs.materials.MPM.Elastic with E close to 1.0e5. model="neohookean" is not
given for elastic models, and also damping keyword do not use it. Only in case of multimaterial you can use
Muscle and give it self.E_soft = 6. For the rigid part use rho_rigid=500.0 .
- ’MPMEntity’ object has no attribute ’set_friction’
- If asked for rigid object use rigid_box_fakecloud,rigid_pose_as_frames provided rigid.py
- If rigid or liquid isn’t explicitly specified in prompt by user use mpm.elastic for objects
Prompt Interpretation
- If prompt is like turn x into y, make x into y, or make x do this, create a simulation that makes the object
perform the requested action using physically meaningful materials and forces.
- Map high-level text to concrete physics choices. Example, turn into lava implies SPH liquid with reasonable
density and viscosity. Drop from 1 m implies raising initial pos and pts by 1 m before creating the box entity
.
Convex Hulls and Geometry
- Represent the box-like object either as:
a) A convex hull built from pts using getConvexHull(pts) when use_convex_hull is True, or
b) A parametric gs.morphs.Box(pos=pos, size=size) when use_convex_hull is False.
- Always compute aabb_min, aabb_max, pos, and size from pts in the constructor or a builder routine.
Skinning and Output
- During stepping, record particle positions and F_deform and append as described above.
You can obtain Position and F_deform via get_rot(entity) and append as numpy arrays. If a tensor, detach to CPU
first.
- In query, call use deform_centers_and_rot like:
centers, F, mapping = deform_centers_and_rot(
simulations, F_deform, self.pts, mapping=self.mapping, use_birdal_quat=self.use_birdal_quat)
Maintain and reuse self.mapping once it is populated to keep k-NN consistent.
Query always returns centers, F, self.liquid_resample
Multimaterial Hybrid Objects
- For multimaterial object follow the multimaterial.py, where upper 50% is rigid, lower is muscle-elastic. Change
the materials of these parts if requested by user.
Figure 8. Instructions (lines 51-100)
3

<!-- page 14 -->
- For multimaterial object follow the multimaterial.py, where upper 50% is rigid, lower is muscle-elastic. Change
the materials of these parts if requested by user.
-For multimaterial elastic means muscle with nu around 0.005, model="neohooken", n_groups=2
-use rho_soft around 1, rho_rigid around 500.0 .
- mu_ground= 0.35 mu_block= 0.35 are allowed for multimaterial
- When the prompt says "lower part rigid, upper part elastic," always use the lower segment’s geometry to create
the rigid URDF (with proper local frame and no unintended offsets), use the upper segment’s geometry for the
soft body, and apply any small vertical gap to the soft upper piece above the rigid base to prevent overlap.
- use tilt_euler_deg=(8,5,0) and uses R_tilt to offset the soft center by gap along local +z.
- computes (trans0, quat0) via gu.transform_pos_quat_by_trans_quat(geom.init_pos, geom.init_quat, base.init_x_pos,
base.init_x_quat) - i.e., transforms the geom’s local pose by the link’s initial pose
Safety and Stability Checklist, apply before finalizing
- Time step dt, substeps, and particle size are moderate and similar to examples.
- Material parameters are within realistic ranges for the described effect.
- The first step() call samples at most one frame into buffers.
- positions and F_deform have consistent shapes for concatenation.
- The ground plane exists and sits under the initial object AABB.
- SPH sampler, if used, is regular, pbs, or pbs-sdf_res.
- No function from common.py has been modified or re-implemented.
- The class signature, method names, concatenation lines, and import header are exactly as specified.
