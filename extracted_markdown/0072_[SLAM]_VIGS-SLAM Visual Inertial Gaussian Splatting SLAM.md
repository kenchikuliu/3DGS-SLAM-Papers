Abstract. We present VIGS-SLAM, a visual-inertial 3D Gaussian Splat-
ting SLAM system that achieves robust real-time tracking and high-
fidelity reconstruction. Although recent 3DGS-based SLAM methods
achieve dense and photorealistic mapping, their purely visual design de-
grades under challenging conditions such as motion blur, low texture,
and exposure variations. Our method tightly couples visual and inertial
cues within a unified optimization framework, jointly optimizing cam-
era poses, depths, and IMU states. It features robust IMU initialization,
time-varying bias modeling, and loop closure with consistent Gaussian
updates. Experiments on five challenging datasets demonstrate our su-
periority over state-of-the-art methods. The code will be made public.

Introduction
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a key problem in robotics
and computer vision, enabling autonomous navigation, augmented (AR) and
mixed reality (VR) applications. Recent advances in neural implicit represen-
tations [42] and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [27] have transformed SLAM

mapping from sparse point clouds to dense, photorealistic scene reconstructions.
In particular, 3DGS SLAM methods [53,65] demonstrate that 3D Gaussian prim-
itives provide a compact yet expressive scene representation, enabling real-time
dense mapping and photorealistic novel view synthesis. However, most existing
3DGS-based SLAM systems remain purely visual: they rely on visual correspon-
dences for tracking and often degrade under motion blur, textureless regions, low
frame rate, or transient occlusions – conditions common in real-world scenarios.
Meanwhile, inertial measurement units (IMUs) have become ubiquitous –
integrated in virtually every modern smartphone [37, 52], AR headset [20, 41],
and consumer camera [21–23]. These sensors are low-cost (MEMS often under $1
per chip) yet provide high-frequency measurements of acceleration and angular
velocity, complementing vision by stabilizing tracking, recovering metric scale,
and maintaining robustness under visually degraded conditions.
Traditional visual-inertial odometry (VIO) and SLAM such as OKVIS [30],
MSCKF [43], VINS-Mono [48], and ORB-SLAM3 [4] are typically formulated
as either filtering-based or optimization-based frameworks, that fuse visual ob-
servations with inertial measurements. Most systems rely on sparse geometric
features such as BRISK [29] or ORB [51], while others adopt direct photometric
alignment such as VI-DSO [58] to jointly optimize image intensities. Despite their
accuracy, these representations produce only sparse or semi-dense point maps.
The recent state-of-the-art visual SLAM system DROID-SLAM [57] reformu-
lates dense correspondence estimation and bundle adjustment within a learned,
differentiable framework, enabling iterative refinement of correspondences and
joint optimization over camera poses and per-pixel disparities. This formulation
is particularly well-suited for Gaussian initialization, as the 3D Gaussians can be
directly initialized from the unprojected point cloud derived from the estimated
disparities. However, DROID-SLAM [57] and subsequent Gaussian-Splatting ex-
tensions [53,65] remain purely visual, without exploiting inertial measurements
that could further enhance robustness.
The very few existing VIO 3DGS-SLAM approaches [44,56,61] exhibit several
limitations, such as reliance on depth sensors, naive fusion of IMU data through
pairwise (non-windowed) constraints, fixed IMU bias, or decoupled alternating
optimization. Therefore, they suffer from reduced accuracy, limited robustness,
and blurry renderings. In contrast, we develop VIGS-SLAM, a highly robust
SLAM system that achieves both real-time accurate tracking and high-fidelity
Gaussian reconstruction. Our method tightly couples visual and inertial energy
terms into a unified optimization framework, incorporates robust multi-stage
IMU initialization and efficient loop closure with consistent Gaussian updates.
This design improves tracking accuracy, reduces drift, enhances robustness under
challenging conditions (e.g., motion blur, low texture, exposure variations, dy-
namic objects), and yields higher-fidelity renderings. Extensive experiments on
five diverse datasets, including a challenging self-captured visual-inertial dataset,
demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Related Work
Visual-Inertial Odometry and SLAM. An early and seminal visual-inertial
odometry approach is MSCKF [43], which introduced a feature-marginalizing
EKF that maintains a sliding window of cloned states, achieving real-time op-
eration with a bounded state size. Follow-ups [18,34] improved consistency, ob-
servability, and robustness, and inspired open implementations [2,14].
In parallel, optimization-based methods jointly minimize reprojection and
preintegrated IMU residuals via a sliding-window nonlinear least-squares formu-
lation. OKVIS [30] tightly couples reprojection and IMU residuals in a keyframe
bundle-adjustment backend. VINS-Mono [48] adds robust initialization, loop clo-
sure, and relocalization. ICE-BA [35] streamlines efficient incremental BA. ORB-
SLAM3 [4] unifies visual and visual-inertial modes with multi-map management
and loop closing. Despite strong accuracy, these pipelines typically rely on sparse
features or direct pixel intensities, which makes them brittle under low texture,
motion blur, repetitive patterns, strong illumination/exposure changes. They
also produce sparse (or semi-dense) maps that limit downstream tasks such as
dense reconstruction, semantics, and photorealistic rendering.
DBA-Fusion [70] is the first to leverage dense correspondences from DROID-
SLAM [57] for visual-inertial SLAM. Our VIGS-SLAM also utilizes the same
dense correspondences, but incorporates and optimizes visual-inertial constraints
in a fundamentally different manner. DBA-Fusion [70] employs a cascaded two-
stage framework: visual bundle adjustment is first solved independently, and
the resulting Schur-complement Hessian is injected as a linearized factor into
GTSAM [9] inertial optimizer. This separation introduces a linearization gap
that can only be partially mitigated through outer re-linearization iterations,
resulting in limited robustness due to the lack of coherent visual-inertial fusion.
In contrast, VIGS-SLAM implements custom CUDA kernels for inertial bundle
adjustment that directly fuse visual and inertial Hessian contributions within a
single normal-equation solve per iteration. This formulation enables true tightly
coupled joint optimization over poses, velocities, and biases, leading to improved
numerical consistency and robustness.
Furthermore, beyond tightly coupled optimization, our system integrates ro-
bust staged IMU initialization, efficient loop closure and Gaussian Splatting-
based dense mapping, resulting in a unified visual-inertial Gaussian Splatting
SLAM framework that improves tracking accuracy and robustness while en-
abling high-fidelity dense reconstruction and novel view synthesis.
Neural Implicit and 3DGS SLAM. Neural implicit representations and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have gained significant attention in SLAM for accu-
rate dense reconstruction and realistic novel view synthesis. Early systems such
as iMAP [55] and NICE-SLAM [74] established unified pipelines that jointly
perform mapping and tracking with neural fields. Subsequent work improves ef-
ficiency and scalability through compact encodings [24,28,59], extends to monoc-
ular settings [1,8,50,66,73], and integrates semantics [31,64,72]. 3DGS [27] pro-
vides an explicit and efficient alternative, which sparked a wave of SLAM sys-

Fig. 2: System Overview. VIGS-SLAM takes a sequence of RGB frames and IMU
readings as input, and simultaneously estimates camera poses while building a 3D
Gaussian map G. Keyframes are selected based on optical flow, and each new keyframe
is initialized using the IMU pre-integration from the previous keyframe. This keyframe
is then added to the local frame graph, where visual-inertial bundle adjustment jointly
optimizes camera poses, depths, and IMU parameters. Visual correspondences are it-
eratively refined using a recurrent ConvGRU module. In parallel, a global pose graph
is maintained using relative pose constraints from the frontend tracking. For Gaussian
mapping, the depth of each new keyframe is unprojected into 3D using the estimated
pose, converted into initial Gaussians, and fused into the global map. Both color and
depth re-rendering losses are used to refine the Gaussians. Loop closure detection is
performed based on optical flow differences between the new keyframe and all previous
ones. When a loop is detected, pose graph bundle adjustment is performed, followed
by an efficient Gaussian update to maintain global consistency.
tems [5,10,16,17,19,26,32,33,40,47,53,62,65,69,71]. Among them, MonoGS [40]
is the first to achieve near real-time monocular SLAM using 3DGS as the sole
map representation, while Splat-SLAM [53] and HI-SLAM2 [65] further improve
pose accuracy and map fidelity.
Integrating IMU sensor with monocular or RGB-D neural-implicit/3DGS
SLAM remains underexplored. NeRF-VINS [25] and NeRF-VIO [67] address
map-based visual-inertial localization on a prior NeRF representation, rather
than performing full SLAM. MM3DGS-SLAM [56] and VIGS-Fusion [44] primar-
ily target RGB-D+IMU settings. Only MM3DGS-SLAM supports RGB input by
treating monocular depth as sensor depth. GI-SLAM [36] reports stereo+IMU re-
sults on EuRoC [3] and a monocular+IMU variant on TUM [54] using accelerom-
eter measurements only, without considering the gyroscope. VINGS-Mono [61]
adopts the interleaved tracking scheme of DBA-Fusion [70], and thus suffers from
similar robustness limitations and severe drift under challenging environments.
For mapping, while it enables Gaussian reconstruction at kilometer-scale scenes,
the resulting maps often miss fine details.

In contrast to prior work, we jointly optimize visual and inertial terms, in-
corporate robust IMU initialization, and perform efficient loop closure with con-
sistent Gaussian map updates, resulting in improved accuracy and robustness.

Method
We provide an overview of our pipeline in Fig. 2. Our system takes as input a se-
quence of RGB frames {Ii}N
i=1 and raw IMU measurements {ak, ωk}M
k=1, where
ak and ωk denote the angular velocity and linear acceleration. It simultaneously
performs camera tracking and Gaussian Splatting Mapping. In detail, we first
perform a staged IMU initialization to recover the metric scale, gravity direc-
tion, and IMU parameters. After initialization, incoming frames are processed
by the frontend tracking module, which selects keyframes and forms a local
frame graph E. Camera motion as well as IMU parameters are then optimized
within this graph by jointly minimizing both visual and inertial residuals. Paral-
lel to tracking, we incrementally build and refine a 3D Gaussian Splatting Map
for high-quality rendering. Loop closures are detected and performed efficiently,
with corresponding Gaussian updates to ensure global consistency.
3.1
Tracking
The tracking module processes sequential images online, creating a new keyframe
when the optical-flow magnitude to the last keyframe exceeds a threshold. To
limit drift from IMU pre-integration over long time intervals, we also force a new
keyframe at least every tkf seconds. We formalize our tracking as an optimiza-
tion problem where, for each keyframe i, we optimize camera pose Ti = (Ri, pi),
disparity di, velocity vi, and IMU bias bi = [bT
gi, bT
ai]T (gyroscope bgi and ac-
celerometer bias bai). In the following, we first introduce the visual and inertial
residuals, followed by the optimization modules that build upon these residuals.
Vision Residual. Following DROID-SLAM [57], we utilize a learned GRU-
based update operator to predict and iteratively update the correspondence
u∗
ij and its associated confidence map wij between a keyframe pair (i, j). We
jointly optimize per-keyframe camera pose T and disparity d by minimizing a
reprojection error between the refined correspondence u∗
ij and that computed
from the current pose and disparity. The vision residuals are formulated as:
  \foo t no t
e
size \b
egin
 { a ligned} \lab el {
eq:
vis ion} E_{\mathrm {vis}} (\bm {T}, \bm {d}) = \sum _{(i,j) \in \mathcal E} \left \| \bm {u^{*}}_{ij} - \Pi (\bm {T}_{ij} \Pi ^{-1}(\bm {u}_i, \bm {d}_i)) \right \|^2_{\bm {\Sigma }_{ij}}, \end {aligned} 
(1)
where Σij = diag(wvis
ij ). Here, we loop over edges (i, j) within a frame graph
E connecting co-visible keyframes, and Tij represents the relative transform be-
tween frames i and j. We denote the projection and back-projection functions
as Π and Π−1. Parameter ui is the 2D image coordinate in frame i. Function
∥· ∥Σ denotes the Mahalanobis distance, weighting the residuals according to
the confidence wvis
ij .

Inertial Residual. For each consecutive keyframe pair (i, j), we first perform
IMU pre-integration [12] between timestamps ti and tj to efficiently fuse the
high-frequency IMU data. The pre-integration yields relative rotation ∆Rij,
position ∆pij, and velocity ∆vij, together with the corresponding Jacobians
(Jrot
ij , Jpos
ij , Jvel
ij ) and covariance Σiner
ij
.
In the inertial residual, we jointly optimize camera pose Ti, velocity vi and
IMU bias bi by minimizing the discrepancy between the current relative camera
motion and the corresponding preintegrated IMU measurements. Additionally,
we include a temporal bias smoothness term. The inertial residuals are formu-
lated as follows:

inertial frame, G denotes its magnitude, and \pr o tect \bm  {R}_{\mathrm {wg}} \in \mathrm {SO}(3) is the rotation from
the inertial frame to the world frame. For simplicity, we omit the transformation
Tcb between the camera and IMU coordinate frames in the equations; however,
it is taken into account in the implementation.
Frontend Tracking: Local Bundle Adjustment. We maintain a sliding-
window local frame graph E, following DROID-SLAM [57]. For pose initializa-
tion, we use IMU pre-integration to initialize each new keyframe. To prevent
unreliable inertial cues, we fall back to the previous-pose initialization whenever
the pre-integration uncertainty is high, i.e., when the covariance trace exceeds
a predefined threshold, tr(Σiner
ij
) > τ init
Σ . Using the estimated pose of the new
keyframe, we initialize correspondences to earlier frames via geometric warping,
providing a stronger starting point for the GRU-based update operator. We then
perform joint visual-inertial optimization by minimizing the sum of the vision
Eq. (1) and inertial Eq. (2) residuals on the local frame graph E. The pose T ,
velocity v, bias b and disparity d are jointly optimized using the Levenberg-
Marquardt algorithm through custom CUDA kernels as follows:

where ∆ξ represents the update of [T , v, b], and ∆d denotes the depth update.
Matrix C is diagonal as each term in Eq. (1) depends only on a single depth
value, thus it can be inverted by C−1 = 1/C.

Loop Closure: Pose Graph Bundle Adjustment (PGBA). To handle loop
closure efficiently, inspired by [65], we adopt PGBA rather than a full global BA,
trading a small amount of accuracy for substantial speed up. A parallel loop-
detector builds loop edges E∗based on optical flow differences. We dynamically
grow the relative pose graph E+ by adding the relative pose from local frame
graph E. We restrict heavy vision updates to only loop closure pairs E∗and add
lightweight relative-pose constraints over the whole pose graph E+ as follows:

where ˜Tij is the relative pose in the pose graph, and Σrel
ij
are relative-pose
covariance from pairwise dense two-view correspondences as in [65]. The graph
is optimized in Sim(3) to correct long-term scale drift.
3.2
IMU Initialization
At the beginning of each sequence, we initialize the IMU using a carefully de-
signed three-stage procedure to ensure stable visual-inertial coupling.
Stage 1: Pure Vision Initialization. Using the first N vis
init keyframes, we min-
imize Eq. (1) to estimate poses Ti and disparities di up to a single global scale.
Stage 2: Inertial-Only Optimization. We continue visual tracking until N iner
init
keyframes are available. We solve the inertial objective Eq. (2) restricted to only
the Rwg, thereby aligning the gravity direction. Keeping Ti fixed, we augment
the optimization variables with per-keyframe velocities vi, and IMU bias bi
together with a global log-scale parameter to recover metric scale. Details are in
the supplementary material.
Stage 3: Visual-Inertial Optimization. We further refine the estimates by
jointly minimizing the visual and inertial objectives in Eqs. 1 and 2, respectively.
Our staged initialization enhances robustness by postponing visual-inertial cou-
pling until the IMU parameters can be reliably estimated.
3.3
Gaussian Splatting Mapping
Preliminary. We utilize the 3D Gaussian representation [27] to model scene
appearance and geometry. The scene is represented by a set of anisotropic Gaus-
sians G = {gi}K
i=1. Each Gaussian gi contains color ci ∈R3, opacity oi ∈[0, 1],
mean µi ∈R3, and covariance matrix Σi ∈R3×3. The color of each pixel in the
rendered image is calculated by alpha-blending the visible Gaussians. Following
prior work [40,63], we replace spherical-harmonic colors with direct RGB value,
reducing optimization complexity.
Map Management. We initialize the Gaussian map by unprojecting the new
keyframe’s depth D (converted from disparity d) into 3D, setting each Gaus-
sian’s color c to the corresponding pixel color and its opacity o to 0.5. For each
new keyframe, we run 10 mapping iterations. In each iteration, we randomly

<!-- page 8 -->

Zihan Zhu et al.
sample keyframes from the frontend tracking frame graph E along with two
global keyframes to render color ˆI and depth ˆD from the Gaussian map. We
calculate color loss Lc = ∥ˆI −I∥1 and depth loss Ld = ∥ˆD −D∥1, as well as
isotropic regularization loss Liso [40] to prevent excessive elongation in sparsely
observed regions. The optimization minimizes the following weighted total loss:
  \lab e l {e q :render}  \mathcal {L} = \lambda _d \mathcal {L}_d + \lambda _c \mathcal {L}_c + \lambda _{iso} \mathcal {L}_{iso} \, . 
(5)
Loop Closure Gaussian Update. After loop closure, the poses and scales
of all keyframes in the relative pose graph are updated. To keep the map con-
sistent without reinitializing and reoptimizing all Gaussians, we propagate each
keyframe’s update to the Gaussians anchored to it. For keyframe k, let pre-
/post-PGBA poses be (R−
k , p−
k ) and (R+
k , p+
k ), and let the scale change be δsk.
For any Gaussian gi initialized from keyframe k with mean µ−
i and covariance
Σ−
i , we update by first transforming into the old camera frame, applying the
scale, then mapping to the new world frame as follows:

(7)
while oi and ci remain unchanged. This entire update is applied in batch oper-
ations for high efficiency.

Datasets. We evaluate on the EuRoC [3], RPNG AR Table [6], UTMM [56],
FAST-LIVO2 [68] datasets, as well as a self-captured dataset. The EuRoC dataset
provides grayscale images, while the others offer RGB ones. For FAST-LIVO2 [68]
dataset, we use the poses from FAST-LIVO2 [68] as ground truth since it lever-
ages LiDAR measurements. For our self-captured dataset, we use the Manifold
Odin 1 [38], whose offline processing tool MindCloud [39] provides ground-truth
poses via LiDAR-visual-inertial fusion. The remaining datasets provide motion-
capture ground truth. Additional details are provided in the supp. material.

over 10 minutes). Results with these refinements are provided in the supple-
mentary material. For brevity, we report all methods on the EuRoC dataset [3]
and evaluate only the stronger and representative baselines in subsequent exper-
iments. For DBA-Fusion [70] and its successor VINGS-Mono [61], we worked
closely with the first author of VINGS-Mono [61] and made targeted mod-
ifications to improve their performance (see supplementary material for de-
tails). As confirmed by its authors, MM3DGS-SLAM [56] primarily targets an
RGB+LiDAR+IMU setup; the open-sourced code does not fully support a pure
visual-inertial setting. It is evaluated only on the UTMM dataset [56], and we
copy the tracking results from the paper.
Metrics. For camera tracking, we align the estimated trajectory to the ground
truth using evo [15], and report the Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) in terms
of RMSE [54]. In addition, we report Recall – percentage of ground-truth poses
whose translation error to the trajectory is below a threshold. For rendering

evaluation, we report PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS on frames that are not used
as keyframes by any method, excluding all views involved in mapping. Conse-
quently, the rendering results reported by MM3DGS-SLAM [56] are not directly
comparable to ours. In the tables, we use ‘F’ to denote failure, either unable to
initialize or significant drift.

EuRoC Dataset [3]. As shown in Table 1, our approach achieves the best over-
all ATE, ranking first or second in most sequences. In contrast, purely feedfor-
ward methods like TTT3R [7] accumulate large drift over time. ORB-SLAM3 [4],
a highly engineered system with robust optimization and loop-closure mecha-
nisms, lags behind our method. We attribute this to its reliance on handcrafted
sparse features and non-differentiable components, which limit its robustness. In
contrast, our system leverages dense, learning-based visual correspondences and
tightly couples inertial constraints into a unified framework.

RPNG AR Table Dataset [6]. The tracking and rendering accuracies are
shown in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively. The proposed VIGS-SLAM achieves
the lowest tracking errors, halving the error of the second-best VINS-Mono [48],
while also leading to the highest novel view synthesis scores. Qualitative results
in Fig. 3 show sharper and more faithful high-frequency details (especially in the
tablecloth and carpet), while baselines produce blurred textures.
UTMM Dataset [56]. We additionally evaluate our method on the UTMM
dataset, introduced in MM3DGS-SLAM [56]. Since the non-LiDAR variant of
MM3DGS-SLAM has not been publicly released, we compare against the results
reported in their paper. As shown in Table 4, our method achieves substantially
more accurate tracking results than baselines. Rendering results are shown in
Fig. 3 and Table 3. This dataset is particularly challenging due to its cluttered
backgrounds with fine-grained structures, coupled with foreground objects that

FAST-LIVO2 Dataset [68]. We further evaluate on the challenging FAST-
LIVO2 dataset, which features outdoor sequences with low frame rates, shaky
motion, and reflective surfaces. As shown in Table 5, classical VIO systems ex-
hibit frequent initialization failures despite repeated restarts. Our method ro-
bustly initializes from the first frame and maintains stable tracking throughout
all sequences, achieving the lowest average tracking error. Rendering results in
Table 3 and Fig. 3 show sharp and consistent reconstructions with preserved
text and edges, benefiting from effective loop-closure handling that maintains a
consistent Gaussian map, especially in outdoor sequences with large loops.

Tracking Robustness
Strided Evaluation. To evaluate robustness under degraded visual input, we
create strided variants of the EuRoC [3] and RPNG AR Table [6] datasets by
temporally subsampling RGB frames with different strides while keeping the
original IMU readings, simulating frame drops, limited bandwidth and high-
speed motion. We report average Recall@5cm and Recall@10cm instead of ATE
RMSE, because several methods fail on certain sequences, making it difficult
to compute meaningful ATE averages. We assign a recall score of zero when
a method fails to produce a valid trajectory. As shown in Fig. 4, our method
remains stable and consistently outperforms all baselines, whereas others fre-
quently fail to initialize or lose tracking under large inter-frame gaps.
Self-Captured Dataset. We further capture 18 challenging sequences spanning
(i) appearance degradation, including motion blur, exposure changes, sun glare,
and low-light conditions; (ii) geometric ambiguity, such as low texture, repeti-
tive patterns, and reflective or transparent surfaces; (iii) interference caused by
dynamic objects; (iv) aggressive camera motion with hand-held shake; and (v)

for more results and dataset details.

Ablation Study
Tracking. We report ablation results for 6 design choices in Table 6. In (a) w/o
IMU Bias Estimation, the IMU bias is fixed to zero and not optimized. In (b)
w/o IMU Fusion, the optimization is constrained solely by visual residuals. In
(c), we remove the inertial-only optimization stage during IMU initialization. In
(d) w/o KF Pose Initialization with IMU, we disable the IMU pre-integration-
based pose initialization for newly selected keyframes. In (e), we disable the loop
closure. In (f), we optimize a single global IMU bias shared across all keyframes
instead of estimating per-keyframe biases. Table 6 demonstrates that removing
any component will degrade tracking accuracy as well as robustness, while our
full system achieves the best results.
Mapping. We ablate the loop closure Gaussian update in Table 7. Disabling
this update leads to inconsistent Gaussian maps, which in turn leads to rendering
performance degradation.

Conclusion
We present VIGS-SLAM, a novel visual-inertial 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM
system that achieves robust real-time tracking and high-fidelity Gaussian map-
ping. It tightly couples learning-based dense visual correspondences with inertial
constraints within a unified optimization framework. Furthermore, we perform
robust IMU initialization and efficient loop closure with consistent Gaussian up-
dates. Extensive evaluations on five challenging datasets show that VIGS-SLAM
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tracking accuracy and novel view

synthesis quality, and is among the very few methods that succeed on all se-
quences without failure. Code and dataset will be made public.
Limitation. In the current system, the Gaussian map does not directly improve
tracking. Incorporating a Gaussian re-rendering loss for pose optimization yields
only marginal gains, likely because renderings during online optimization are not
yet sufficiently sharp to produce reliable gradients for pose refinement.

Real-time Demo Implementation Details
We include a real-time demo in the supplementary videos, where an iPhone
17 Pro streams RGB frames and IMU measurements to a desktop computer
equipped with an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-14700K CPU and an NVIDIA GeForce
RTX 5090 GPU. Our VIGS-SLAM system robustly tracks camera motion while
simultaneously reconstructing a photorealistic Gaussian map and dense point
clouds in real time. The iPhone capture application is implemented in Swift,
and data transmission is performed over Wi-Fi. The camera intrinsics remain
fixed during capture.

Self-Captured Dataset. For the self-captured dataset described in Sec. 4.2, we
use the Manifold Odin 1 [38] for data acquisition. RGB frames are captured at
10 FPS, while IMU measurements are recorded at 400 Hz. The camera intrinsics
and camera-IMU extrinsics are factory pre-calibrated. The original images are
captured with a fisheye lens; we undistort them to a pinhole model before feeding
them to all methods. The accompanying offline processing tool, MindCloud [39],

provides ground-truth poses via LiDAR-visual-inertial fusion. In total, we cap-
ture 18 sequences across diverse indoor and outdoor environments, with trajec-
tory lengths ranging from 34 to 1079 meters and sequence durations from 47
seconds to 10 minutes. The input sequences are visualized in the supplementary
video. We use Deface [46] to blur human faces and EgoBlur [49] to blur vehicle

Baseline Implementation Details
For DBA-Fusion [70] and its successor VINGS-Mono [61], we worked closely with
the first author of VINGS-Mono [61] and applied several targeted modifications
to improve their stability and performance.
8.1
DBA-Fusion [70]
On the EuRoC dataset [3], the drone often remains static or exhibits only small
motions at the beginning of a sequence. In this scenario, DBA-Fusion’s vision-
only keyframe selection tends to cause severe drift due to long IMU preintegra-
tion intervals. To mitigate this issue, we enforce the insertion of a new keyframe
at least every 20 frames, even when the frontend motion filter does not trigger
keyframe selection. This strategy prevents excessively long IMU preintegration
intervals and reduces accumulated noise.
For the UTMM dataset [56], some sequences do not reach the default thresh-
old required for IMU initialization throughout the entire sequence, resulting in
no IMU initialization being performed. To address this issue, we lower the IMU
initialization threshold to 0.15 for those sequences.

8.2
VINGS-Mono [61]
For VINGS-Mono, we apply the same modifications as for DBA-Fusion on the
EuRoC and UTMM datasets [3, 56]. In addition, we observe that disabling
monocular metric depth and loop closure yields more robust results. We sus-
pect this is because the metric depth model does not generalize well to our
datasets, and the loop closure module occasionally produces false positives or
estimates inaccurate relative poses for loop closure frames. Therefore, we disable
these components in all experiments.

Our VIGS-SLAM Implementation Details
Except for the number of keyframes used in IMU initialization N iner
init , all datasets
share the same hyperparameters.
Frontend Tracking. A new keyframe is created when the average optical-flow
magnitude exceeds τkf = 2.4. To reduce IMU pre-integration drift, we also enforce
a keyframe at least every tkf = 3 s. For each new keyframe, we initialize its pose
using IMU pre-integration unless the estimated uncertainty is too high. When
the covariance trace tr(Σiner
ij
) exceeds τ init
Σ
= 10−4, we revert to initializing the
new keyframe with the pose of the previous keyframe.
Loop Closure. Loop-closure detection runs in parallel with the frontend track-
ing. We only compare the current keyframe against earlier keyframes that are
at least τLC-gap = 55 keyframes apart to avoid redundant loop candidates. A
loop-closure edge is added when the average optical-flow magnitude falls below
τLC-flow = 22 and the relative orientation difference is below τLC-ang = 120◦.
IMU Initialization. Pure-vision initialization is performed once the number
of keyframes reaches N vis
init = 10. Inertial initialization begins when the keyframe
count reaches N iner
init , which is set to 20 by default (25 for FAST-LIVO2 due to
rapid motion and 15 for UTMM due to short trajectory).
After completing the vision-only initialization, we begin inertial-only initial-
ization by first recovering the gravity direction Rwg. Then we aim to recover
IMU parameters as well as convert the trajectory to metric scale by introduc-
ing a global log-scale parameter s ∈R. The positions and velocities are then
rewritten as
  \ bm  {p}
_ i
 & =  e ^{s}
\ ,
\bm
 { p }_ i^{\
t e
xt  {v is}}
,  & \bm {v}_i &= e^{s}\,\bm {v}_i^{\text {vis}}, \\ \bm {p}_j &= e^{s}\,\bm {p}_j^{\text {vis}}, & \bm {v}_j &= e^{s}\,\bm {v}_j^{\text {vis}}.
(2)
During this stage, the visual poses T vis
i
= (Ri, pi) are kept fixed, and we solve
for the gravity direction Rwg, IMU bias bi, per-keyframe velocity vi, and the
scale parameter s. Finally, we perform full visual–inertial initialization by incor-
porating the camera poses into the optimization as well.
Final Global Bundle Adjustment. Following prior works [53,57,65,69], we
optionally perform a final global bundle adjustment step to refine all poses. We
adopt the same global frame-graph construction as prior works and optimize only

vision residuals, as inertial constraints mainly benefit initialization and coarse
pose estimation, but offer limited improvement during the refinement stage.
Unless otherwise specified, all reported results reflect the online performance
before this final refinement.
Final Color Refinement. Similar to prior works [53, 65, 69], after the final
global bundle adjustment, we optionally perform a global refinement of the Gaus-
sian map using all keyframes. Specifically, in each iteration we randomly sample
a keyframe from the global keyframe list and minimize the rendering loss in
Eq. (5) to update the Gaussian map. Similar to the final global bundle adjust-
ment, all rendering metrics we report are taken before this refinement step, unless
explicitly stated otherwise.

Additional Experiments
Runtime and Memory Analysis. We report the runtime evaluation on the
RPNG dataset in Table 9. All experiments are conducted on a desktop equipped
with an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-14700K CPU and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090
GPU. FPS is computed as the total number of frames divided by the total run-
time in seconds. GPU memory reports the peak GPU memory usage, indicating
suitability for deployment on common robotic platforms such as Jetson Orin NX
and Jetson AGX Orin.
To accelerate runtime, we identified several bottlenecks in the underlying
codebases we build upon, DROID-SLAM [57] and HI-SLAM2 [65], such as inef-
ficient Python for-loops, and introduced targeted optimizations to address them.
In addition, we deploy TensorRT [45] for neural network inference, implement
IMU preintegration in C++, and perform Jacobian and Hessian computations
using custom CUDA kernels.

suffer from severe drift under challenging conditions. Although VINGS-Mono [61]
and DBA-Fusion [70] incorporate IMU signals, their interleaved optimization
strategies still limit robustness. In contrast, our VIGS-SLAM achieves the best
performance, benefiting from the proposed tightly coupled visual-inertial joint
optimization, together with robust IMU initialization and effective loop closure.
Simulation of Various Visual Degradation. To evaluate our methods ro-
bustness under progressively degraded visual input, we apply controlled pho-
tometric corruptions to the RGB input frames. Motion Blur is simulated by
convolving each image with a linear motion kernel of fixed length k pixels, where
the blur direction is independently sampled per frame from a uniform distribu-
tion over [0, 2π). Given an input image I ∈[0, 1], the resulting image is given by
  I_{ \ t e xt { blu
r } } = I * K(k, \theta ), \quad \theta \sim \mathcal {U}(0, 2\pi ), 
(3)
where K(k, θ) denotes a motion blur kernel with strength k and direction θ.
Larger kernel sizes correspond to more severe motion blur. Overexposure is
modeled by amplifying image intensities followed by highlight clipping:
  I_{ \ text {ov er }} = \mathrm {clip}(\beta I, 0, 1), 
(4)
where β > 1 controls the exposure level and progressively saturates bright re-
gions, significantly reducing texture and local contrast. Low-light conditions
are simulated by first reducing image exposure and contrast using a gamma
transformation, followed by the injection of realistic sensor noise. We apply
  I _{\
g a mma } = I^{\gamma }, \quad \gamma > 1, 
(5)
which models reduced illumination and nonlinear camera response under low-
light conditions. We then add signal-dependent shot noise and additive Gaussian

left ( \frac {\mathrm {Poisson}(s \cdot I_{\gamma })}{s} + \mathcal {N}(0,\sigma ^2), \,0,\,1 \right ), 
(6)
where s denotes the photon scale and σ is the standard deviation of Gaussian
noise. This formulation jointly reduces visual contrast and amplifies noise in a
physically plausible manner. As shown in Table 11, Table 12 and Table 13, our
method remains robust under various challenges thanks to our tightly coupled
vision-inertial fusion.

Across all datasets, our method achieves the best average performance, both with
and without the final global BA refinement.
Detailed Rendering Results. We report detailed per-sequence rendering re-
sults both before the final color refinement (with average results shown in Table 3
of the main paper) and after refinement. The full results are provided in Table 18,
Table 19, and Table 20.
Detailed Results for Strided Evaluation. We further include detailed per-
sequence results for the strided evaluation shown in Fig. 4 in the main paper, as
shown in Table 21 and Table 22.
While ATE RMSE is a widely used accuracy metric, it alone can be mis-
leading under strided evaluation. A method may fail to track large portions of
a sequence yet still obtain a low ATE by aligning only a short, easy segment.
To address this limitation, we additionally report Recall metrics, which quantify
how much of the trajectory is successfully tracked within a given error thresh-
old and provide a more comprehensive view of robustness. Unlike classical VIO
methods that select favorable starting points, we initialize from the first N iner
init
keyframes and track the entire sequence from the beginning. For instance, in the
RPNG dataset table_02 at stride = 10, ORB-SLAM3 [4] achieves a seemingly
low ATE of 0.20 \,\mathrm {cm} but with only 10.72\% recall@10cm, as it initializes success-
fully only after roughly 220 frames (given the stride) and tracks a short segment
before losing track. In contrast, our method attains 1.51 \,\mathrm {cm} ATE with 100.00\%
recall, reflecting both robustness and complete trajectory coverage.
