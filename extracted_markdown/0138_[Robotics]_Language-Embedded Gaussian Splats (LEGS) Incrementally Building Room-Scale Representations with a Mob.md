Abstract— Building semantic 3D maps is valuable for search-
ing for objects of interest in offices, warehouses, stores, and
homes. We present a mapping system that incrementally builds
a Language-Embedded Gaussian Splat (LEGS): a detailed
3D scene representation that encodes both appearance and
semantics in a unified representation. LEGS is trained online
as a robot traverses its environment to enable localization
of open-vocabulary object queries. We evaluate LEGS on 4
room-scale scenes where we query for objects in the scene to
assess how LEGS can capture semantic meaning. We compare
LEGS to LERF [1] and find that while both systems have
comparable object query success rates, LEGS trains over 3.5x
faster than LERF. Results suggest that a multi-camera setup and
incremental bundle adjustment can boost visual reconstruction
quality in constrained robot trajectories, and suggest LEGS can
localize open-vocabulary and long-tail object queries with up
to 66% accuracy.

Consider open vocabulary robot requests such as “Where
are gluten-free crackers?” or “Get a stain remover spray”, a
robot must parse such queries, localize relevant objects, and
navigate to them. A large body of recent work uses large
vision-language models by distilling their outputs into 3D
representations like point clouds or NeRFs [2]. These semantic
representations have been applied to both manipulation [3],
[4], [5] and large-scale scene understanding [6], [7], [8],
showing promise of using large models zero-shot for open-
vocabulary task specification.
One key challenge for scaling these methods to large
environments is the underlying 3D representation, which
should be flexible to a variety of scales, able to update with
new observations, and fast. Although NeRFs are commonly
used as the 3D representation for distilling 2D semantic
features [9], [10], [1], scaling NeRFs to large scenes can be
cumbersome because they typically rely on a fixed spatial
resolution [11], [12], [13], are difficult to modify, and slower
to render. A popular alternative is pointclouds [14], [7], [8],
[6], which work seamlessly with many SLAM algorithms.
However, a given point is assigned a single color and semantic
feature by fusing CLIP in the pointcloud with a contrastively
supervised field, whereas a multi-scale model of the world can
simultaneously reason about objects and their parts, similar

to how LERF-TOGO [5] leverages multi-scale semantics in
LERF [1].
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [16] models the 3D scene
using a large set of 3D Gaussians. Recent works [17], [18]
successfully assign semantic features to every Gaussian in
the scene. However, existing techniques combining semantic
features and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene reconstruc-
tion require offline computation of keyframe transforms and
3D Gaussian initialization points.
In this paper, we focus on linking language understanding
to Gaussian Splats in large-scale scenes, while incremen-
tally training on a stream of RGBD images of the scene
from a mobile robot. This incremental training method
offers substantial benefits, notably enabling the robot to
autonomously determine its position within the environment
and subsequently use the map data for enhanced operational
efficiency.
LEGS combines geometry and appearance information
from 3DGS with semantic knowledge from CLIP by ground-
ing language embeddings into the 3DGS similar to the
method described in [17]. LEGS incrementally registers
images and simultaneously optimizes both 3D Gaussians
and dense language fields. This allows robots to build maps
that contain rich representations of their surroundings that
can be queried with natural language.
This paper makes 3 contributions:
• An online multi-camera 3DGS reconstruction system for
large-scale scenes. The system takes as input three video
streams from a mobile robot, and incrementally builds

the 3D scene.
• Language-Embedded Gaussian Splatting (LEGS), a
hybrid 3D semantic representation that uses explicit 3D
Gaussians for geometry and implicit scale-conditioned
hashgrid [19] for the semantics.
• Results from physical experiments suggesting LEGS
can produce high quality Gaussian Splats in room-
scale scenes with training time 3.5x faster than a LERF
baseline [1].

A. Mobile Robot Mapping
Early robotic scene mapping research focused on the
development of the core competencies in the metric [20],
[21], [22] and topological [23], [24] knowledge spaces,
extensively centered around the question of map and knowl-
edge representation. For successful task execution, data-rich
3D scene representation and self-localization are critical,
enabled by Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
algorithms [25], [26], [27]. 3D spatial maps have traditionally
been represented by voxel grids, points or surfels, and
more recently, neural radiance fields [28], [29]. Each of
these approaches come with their own limitations. The
accuracy and expressiveness of occupancy and voxel grids
are resolution-bounded due to quantization. Points and surfels
are discontinuous when rendered, making it challenging to
supervise features in a continuous manner. Recent SLAM
methods adopting a neural radiance field representation such
as NICE-SLAM [30] and NeRF-SLAM [31] are constrained
by their implicit representation making it difficult to update
geometry over time.
B. Semantic Scene Mapping for Robotics
Semantic grounding, particularly in 3D representations, is
a longstanding problem [32] to integrate semantic knowledge
of objects and the surrounding environment into a mapped
scene. The first definition of semantic mapping for robotics
is provided by N¨uchter, et al. as a spatial map, 2D or
3D, augmented by information about entities, i.e., objects,
functionalities, or events located in space [33]. An early work
proposes concurrent object identification and localization
using a supervised hierarchical neural network classifier
on image color histogram feature vectors [34]. However,
because these approaches rely on supervised datasets [35],
[36], they work only on a closed set of vocabularies and do
not generalize to open-ended semantic queries.
More recent works have focused on using large vision-
language models to support open-vocabulary queries. This
includes both 2D [37], [38], [39] and 3D, such as VL-Maps [8]
and CLIP-fields [7], which assigns a CLIP feature to every
point in the 3D scene. This can be used for setting navigation
goals with natural language queries. OpenScene [14] ensem-
bles open-vocabulary feature encoders and 3D point networks
to form a per-point feature-vector allowing natural language
querying on pointclouds. ConceptFusion [40] develops 3D
open-set multimodal mapping by projecting CLIP [41] and
pixel aligned features into 3D points, and additionally fuse
other modalities such as audio into the scene representation.
ConceptGraphs [42] model spatial relationships as well as
the semantic objects in the scene to reason over spatial and
semantic concepts.
Semantic fields have been applied not only to scene-level
understanding for mobile robots but also to manipulation.
In these settings, NeRFs [2] have been a popular 3D
representation, following from Distilled Feature Fields [9],
Neural Feature Fusion Fields [10], and Language Embedded
Radiance Fields (LERFs) [1]. These works learn an semantic
field in addition to the color field. LERF supports a scale-
conditioned feature field, which takes in an extra scalar as
input to facilitate feature encodings at multiple scene scales.
For manipulation, the feature fields have been shown to
facilitate learning from few-shot demonstrations [4], policy
learning [3], zero-shot trajectory generation [43], and task-
oriented grasping [5].
LERF-TOGO’s [5] zero-shot task-oriented grasping per-
formance is fully based on LERF, as LERF’s multi-scale
semantics allow for both object- and part-level understanding.
This property is also valuable in scene-level settings, where
a human may specify a collection of objects, e.g., uten-
sils. LEGS maintains this multi-scale understanding, while
speeding up training and querying time, by using Gaussian
Splats [16] which have a significantly faster render time.
C. 3D Gaussian Splatting
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) originated in 2023 [16]
to model a scene as an explicit collection of 3D Gaussians.
Each Gaussian is described by its position vector µ, co-
variance matrix Σ, and an opacity parameter α, creating a
representation that is both succinct and adaptable for static
environments. The choice of 3D Gaussians over traditional
point clouds is strategic; their inherent differentiability and
the ease with which they can be rasterized into 2D splats
enable accelerated α-blending during rendering. By avoiding
volumetric ray casting employed by Neural Radiance Fields
(NeRFs), Gaussian Splatting has a substantial speed advantage
and can support real-time rendering capabilities.
Soon after its release, 3DGS has been applied to map-
ping [44], semantic mapping [45], navigation [46], and
semantic fields [17], [18]. 3DGS’s fast rendering time speeds
up optimization, making it suitable for integrating visual
SLAM and natural language queries for 3D semantic fields.
3DGS has also been demonstrated in both indoor datasets [47],
[48], [49], and outdoor driving scenes with multiple cameras
where all sensor data is collected before 3DGS training [50].
D. Concurrent Research
Other work in 3D Gaussian Splatting has focused on
embedding language features, and separately, training online.
Learning semantic features for Gaussians have taken
either one of two approaches: calculating it on-the-fly by
querying a network or maintaining multi-dimensional features
for each Gaussian. FMGS [17] uses multi-resolution hash
encodings [19] optimized with a render-time loss to combine
CLIP features with a map of 3D Gaussians. LEGS similarly

<!-- page 3 -->
Fig. 2: LEGS System Integration For LEGS, we use a Fetch robot with a custom multicamera configuration where a Realsense D455 is facing forward
while 2 Zed cameras face the left and right sides respectively. The left Zed image stream is inputted into DROID-SLAM to compute pose estimates for the
left camera, and the corresponding extrinsics are used to compute the pose estimates for the other Zed camera and D455. These image-poses are then
used for concurrent Gaussian splat and CLIP training online. From there, the Gaussian splat can be queried for an object (ex. “First Aid Kit”), and the
corresponding relevancy field will be computed to localize the desired object.
utilizes a hash encoding for its feature field, however it
includes scale-conditioning as opposed to averaging CLIP
across scales, retaining finer-grained language understanding.
On the other hand, LangSplat [18] embeds language in 3DGS
by training a scene-specific autoencoder to map between CLIP
embeddings and a lower-dimensional latent feature associated
with each 3D gaussian. Like traditional radiance field methods,
LangSplat assumes poses are corresponded with all scene
images prior to 3DGS training as it requires training a VAE
over all images of a scene before starting its 3D optimization.
However, for robotic systems, it is often desirable to develop
3D semantic understanding online as the robot explores new
and previously unseen large-scale environments.
SplaTAM [44] optimizes both camera pose and the 3D
Gaussian map simultaneously for single-camera setups. How-
ever, having multiple cameras and viewpoints can enhance
efficient environment data collection. Additionally, SplaTAM
lacks semantic features, which is important for identifying
and interacting with objects in a 3D scene.
To our knowledge, LEGS is the first system that integrates
the advantages of both online 3DGS training and language-
aligned feature supervision into Gaussian splats for large-scale
scene understanding.
I I I . P RO B L E M S TAT E M E N T
We consider a large indoor environment, specifically
defined as a room encompassing at least 750 sq ft. The
objective is to 3D reconstruct the a-priori unknown and
unstructured environment and localize objects prompted by
open-vocabulary and long-tail natural-language queries.
We make the following assumptions:
1) The environment and all objects within it are static.
2) Queried objects are seen at least from one of the cameras.
3) A mobile robot with 3 orthogonal cameras. For the
grocery store environment, the TTT robot with a single
pair of stereo cameras is used [15].
For each trial, the system is prompted by a natural-language
query, and outputs the heatmap and localized 3D coordinate
of the most semantically relevant location in the scene. The
trial is deemed successful if this point falls within a manually
annotated bounding box for that object. The objective is
to efficiently build a 3D representation that maximizes this
success rate for large-scale scenes.
IV. M E T H O D S
We use a Fetch mobile robot equipped with an RGB-D
Realsense D455 camera and two side facing ZED 2 stereo
cameras mounted with known relative poses. We build a
map of the scene with a set of 3D Gaussians in an online
fashion, registering new images as the robot drives around
the environment. The overall pipeline for LEGS is outlined
in Figure 2. There are three key components of the system:
1) Multi-Camera Reconstruction: To improve the effec-
tive field-of-view of the robotic system, we use multiple
cameras pointing in different directions to provide more
viewpoints of the environment.
2) Incremental 3DGS Construction: A significant chal-
lenge of large scene mapping is localization error due
to its accumulative nature. To mitigate this error, we
perform global Bundle Adjustment (BA) with DROID-
SLAM to improve pose accuracy for all previously
recorded poses in the scene. Global BA can be executed
multiple times in a given traversal, and after each BA,
the prior image-pose estimates are updated with the
corresponding pose.
3) Language-Embedded Gaussian Splatting: We imple-
ment a language-aligned feature field inspired by the
method from LERF [1] that samples from gaussian
primitives instead of from a density field.
A. Multi-Camera Reconstruction
Online image registration enables Gaussian Splatting on
a mobile base with a comprehensive sensor suite including
multiple camera views (left, right, center). During testing of
vanilla Gaussian Splatting on our multi-camera setup, we
found that offline Structure from Motion (SfM) pipelines

<!-- page 4 -->
frequently failed to find correspondences between images
from different cameras, largely due to the lack of scene
overlap from offset camera views. Because we peform online
image registration with a visual SLAM algorithm for one
camera and we know the corresponding extrinsic transforms
to the other cameras, we can compute the corresponding
pose estimate for each camera. Due to limited GPU memory
onboard the Fetch robot, the image data is then streamed over
network to a desktop computer for processing and training.
B. Incremental 3DGS Construction + Bundle Adjustment
Standard methods for radiance field optimization require
image-pose pairs as input, and Gaussian Splatting greatly
benefits from having a pointcloud as a geometric prior for
initialization. Poses and pointclouds are typically provided
through offline Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques
like COLMAP [51] which require all training images to
be collected ahead of time. We build off of Nerfstudio’s [52]
Splatfacto implementation of Gaussian Splatting and modify
it to operate on a stream of images and poses, and incorporate
updates from global bundle adjustment (BA) to further
optimize poses by building a keyframe graph to minimize
the Mahalanobis distance between the reprojected points and
the corresponding revised optical flow points [53].
1) Online Optimization: For online pose estimation we use
DROID-SLAM [53], a monocular SLAM method that takes
in monocular, stereo, or RGB-D ordered images and outputs
per-keyframe pose estimates and disparity maps. During
operation, we feed DROID-SLAM input frames from one of
the side-facing Zed cameras, and extrapolate the poses of other
cameras using the camera mount CAD model. Registered
RGBD keyframes from DROID-SLAM are incrementally
added to Splatfacto’s training set. We initialize new Gaussian
means per-image by sampling 500 pixels from each depth
image and deproject them into 3D using the corresponding
metric depth measurement. We use a learned stereo depth
model trained on synthetic images [54], which can predict
thin features and transparent objects with high accuracy.
2) Global Bundle Adjustment: Incorporating images with
pose drift from SLAM systems results in artifacts in 3DGS
models like duplicated or fused objects, fuzzy geometry, and
ghosting (Fig. 4). Though prior work has demonstrated that
pose optimization inside a 3DGS can track camera pose [44],
tracking iterations for the method with reported results takes
up to a second to perform, making it difficult for online
usage. Instead, to mitigate drift, we incorporate updates from
global BA and update training camera poses in the 3DGS
accordingly. This allows tracking of new camera frames at
30fps in tandem with continual 3DGS optimization for faster
model convergence.
C. Language Embedded Gaussian Splats
In Language Embedded Radiance Fields (LERF) [1] the
language field is optimized by volumetrically rendering and
supervising CLIP embeddings along rays during training. In
contrast, 3DGS provides direct access to explicit gaussian
means, allowing us to implement a multi-scale language
Fig. 3: 4 Scene Environments.
embedding function, Flang(⃗x,s) ∈RD. This function takes
an input position ⃗x and physical scale s, outputting a D-
dimensional language embedding. Flang is implemented by
passing a sampled ⃗x through a multi-resolution hash encod-
ing [19], which produces the input z to the MLP mθ(z,s), with
the MLP evaluated last resulting in feature output y ∈RD.
These features can then be projected and rasterized into
feature images using Nerfstudio’s [52] tile-based rasterizer
implementation, with loss gradients backpropagated through
the MLP. Hash encoding employs a hash table to store feature
vectors corresponding to grid cells in a multi-resolution
fashion. This hash grid encoding scheme effectively reduces
the number of floating-point operations and memory accesses
needed during training and inference, compared to directly
feeding position features into an MLP.
Language-aligned features are obtained from the training
images using multi-scale crops passed through the CLIP
encoder, a technique shown in LERF to be crucial for
semantic understanding in large scenes where object sizes
may vary drastically. This is in contrast to prior work which
averages CLIP embeddings as a tradeoff between speed and
accuracy [17]. LEGS facilitates inference at approximately
50 Hz 1080p, and its hybrid explicit-implicit representation
allows faster scene querying without volumetric rendering.
Given a natural language query, we query the language field
to obtain a relevancy map similar to LERF. To localize the
query in the world frame, we find the relevancy over CLIP
features and take the argmax relevancy over 3D gaussian
means. This method offers a significant speed increase over
feature field methods distilled in NeRFs, where the volumetric
representation must first render a dense pointcloud.

A. Physical Experiments
We evaluate LEGS through a series of open-vocabulary
object recall tasks. These tasks are designed to measure
the system’s competency in capturing and organizing in-
formation based on both location and semantic meaning.
We evaluate LEGS on four large-scale indoor environments,
two office kitchen scenes containing different objects, an
office workspace, and a grocery store testbed [15] as seen
in Figure 3. For the grocery store testbed, data is collected
with the TTT robot [15]. The robot begins in a previously

D455, and Stereolabs Zed 2 with and without bundle adjustment. For each configuration we present two views: one of the Gaussian splat facing the kitchen
island head-on and another view at an angle.
unseen environment and is manually pushed around a pre-
planned path (including straight lines, loops, figure-8, etc)
while continuously registering new images until it finishes
the path. The robot will actuate its torso height to obtain
multiple azimuthal perspectives from the same position on
subsequent passes. Every 150 keyframes, we perform global
bundle adjustment on all previous poses in DROID-SLAM
and update accordingly in our 3D Gaussian map. Our system
uses 2 NVIDIA 4090s, one for training LEGS, which takes
15 GB of memory and the other for DROID-SLAM, which
can take up to 18 GB of memory.
The evaluation approach was adopted from previous 3D
language mapping works [1], [55]. We randomly sample
images from our training set and query Chat-GPT 4V with:
“name an object in this scene in 3 words or fewer”. This
process is repeated until 15 unique queries are generated for
each of the four scenes. We then choose a random novel
view and manually annotate a 2D bounding box around each
selected object of interest. Then, we query LEGS on each
object and identify the highest activation energy point, and
project that point in the novel 2D view. If the projected point
is contained in the bounding box, we consider the query
successful. Additionally, we directly baseline our approach
by running LERF [1] to compare the object recall capabilities
for a large-scale scene in radiance field methods.
The results in Table 1 suggest that LERF and LEGS
have similar language capabilities, recalling roughly the
same number of objects per scene. However, to achieve
the same visual quality, LERF takes an average time of 44
minutes to train while LEGS only takes 12 minutes. Figure

B. Reconstruction quality comparison
We study how camera configuration and bundle adjustment
(BA) affect the quality of the LEGS Gaussian splat as
summarized in Figure 4 and Table 2. With respect to the
camera configuration ablation, we evaluated different depth
and stereo cameras including the Realsense D435, Realsense
D455, and Zed 2. For each camera configuration, we also
run a BA ablation where we either run bundle adjustment at
the end of the traversal or not at all.
Global Bundle Adjustment: Table II suggests bundle
adjustment improves Gaussian Splat quality for all camera
configurations, removing ghostly duplicate artifacts. This is
especially true for the Realsense D455 and Zed 2 cameras
where the bundle adjustment configurations yielded near-
photorealistic views of the scene whereas without bundle
adjustment, both configurations have significantly more
Gaussian floaters and/or offset objects (i.e. the left image
in Figure 4 part (e) has two volleyballs). The Realsense
D435 performs slightly better with bundle adjustment, but
neither D435 configuration yield high quality largely due to
the camera’s low FOV resulting in worse localization.
We also compared a single Zed 2 camera to a multi-camera
setup where the D455 Realsense is front-facing and 2 Zed
cameras face the left and right side. Both gaussian splats
perform well and properly render objects that were well
viewed in the traversal (“raccoon toy” and “first aid kit”) as
seen in Figure 7. However, none of the cameras were pointing
toward the ground leading to sparse views of objects near the
floor. Because the multi-camera setup captures more views
of the scene, it is able to construct a Gaussian splat that is
better able to render these low-view objects such as the trash
chutes and wet floor sign.
Fig. 7: Single Camera vs Multi Camera Reconstruction. With the multi-
camera setup, the effective field of view is increased, elucidating more of
the scene such as the wet floor sign and trash chutes on the side faces of
the table.
VI. L I M I TAT I O N S
We assume a static environment where objects do not
move during traversal. This limits the scope of this work
because many applications involve dynamic scenes with
moving objects. In future work, we will adapt our method to
work for dynamic scenes.
The motion of the Fetch mobile base can have a large effect
on the LEGS reconstruction quality; the high stiction between
the robot’s caster wheels and the environment introduces jolts,
causing camera pose inaccuracies and image blurs. In the
future, we hope to correct this with a new mobile base where
the trajectory is autonomously determined by a frontier-based
exploration algorithm [56].
Although autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance
has been extensively studied [57], obstacles can pose a
problem when it comes to the 3D Gaussian map if they
are only visible in a few of the ground truth images. 3D
Gaussians are initialized at the deprojected points from these
few images, but there are not enough views to refine and
properly train these Gaussians; the result is oddly colored
floaters that obstruct some parts of the static scene.
When performing natural language queries, LEGS inherits
the limitations of LERF + CLIP distillation into 3D described
by similar works [1]. In our experimentation, we find that
a large scale environment brings additional challenges in
querying, particularly in 1) small or far-field objects in the
training view, 2) similar item-background color features, such
as white objects on white. Language embedded Gaussian
splats can also produce false-positives when querying an
object that is not in the scene due to the presence of visually
or semantically similar objects, which may get incorrectly
classified as the query object.
VII. C O N C L U S I O N
In this work, we introduce Language-Embedded Gaussian
Splats (LEGS), a system that can train Gaussian Splats online
with CLIP embeddings for large-scale indoor scenes. Because
of pose accumulation error that builds up in large scenes, we
use incremental bundle adjustment to improve pose fidelity
for Gaussian Splat training. Results suggest LEGS trains 3.5x
faster than LERF with comparable object recall.
