QuantumGS: Quantum Encoding Framework for Gaussian Splatting
Grzegorz Wilczy´nski 1 2 Rafał Tobiasz 1 2 Paweł Gora 1 Marcin Mazur 1 Przemysław Spurek 1 2
Abstract
Recent advances in neural rendering, particularly
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have enabled
real-time rendering of complex scenes.
How-
ever, standard 3DGS relies on spherical harmon-
ics, which often struggle to accurately capture
high-frequency view-dependent effects such as
sharp reflections and transparency.
While hy-
brid approaches like Viewing Direction Gaus-
sian Splatting (VDGS) mitigate this limitation
using classical Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs),
they remain limited by the expressivity of classi-
cal networks in low-parameter regimes. In this
paper, we introduce QuantumGS, a novel hy-
brid framework that integrates Variational Quan-
tum Circuits (VQC) into the Gaussian Splatting
pipeline. We propose a unique encoding strategy
that maps the viewing direction directly onto the
Bloch sphere, leveraging the natural geometry of
qubits to represent 3D directional data. By re-
placing classical color-modulating networks with
quantum circuits generated via a hypernetwork
or conditioning mechanism, we achieve higher
expressivity and better generalization. Source

1. Introduction
Recent advances in neural rendering have shifted from im-
plicit coordinate-based representations like Neural Radi-
ance Fields (NeRF) (Mildenhall et al., 2020) toward ex-
plicit, point-based methods. Leading this evolution, 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) (Kerbl et al., 2023) achieves
real-time rendering of complex scenes by modeling geom-
etry as anisotropic 3D Gaussians. Despite its excellent
speed-quality trade-off, standard 3DGS struggles with high-
frequency view-dependent effects like sharp specular high-

lights, glossy surfaces, and transparency variations due to
reliance on low-order spherical harmonics for color modula-
tion.
Hybrid extensions like View-opacity-Dependent 3D Gaus-
sian Splatting (VoD-3DGS) (Nowak et al., 2025) and View-
ing Direction Gaussian Splatting (VDGS) (Malarz et al.,
2025) augment 3DGS with learnable matrices or classi-
cal MLPs to extend view-dependence to opacity. While
effective, these classical augmentations remain expressivity-
limited in the low-parameter regime required to preserve
3DGS’s real-time performance.
Concurrently, Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has
demonstrated unique advantages in high-dimensional func-
tion approximation. Prior quantum rendering efforts, Quan-
tum Radiance Fields (QRF) (Yang & Sun, 2023) and QKAN-
GS (Fujihashi et al., 2025), focused on NeRF integration
or 3DGS compression, leaving a critical gap: explicitly
modeling view-dependent radiance via quantum-geometric
encodings.
In this paper, we introduce QuantumGS, a novel quantum-
classical hybrid that embeds Variational Quantum Circuits
(VQCs) directly into the 3DGS pipeline to capture com-

plex view-dependent dynamics. Our key strategy is a Bloch
sphere encoding that maps 3D viewing directions onto qubit
states, naturally representing view-dependent reflectance
through single-qubit rotations. We propose dual VQC con-
trol strategies:
• Pipeline I (Per-Gaussian): A hypernetwork generates
spatially-adaptive VQC parameters (rotation angles)
for each Gaussian, maximizing local expressivity,
• Pipeline II (Global):
A shared VQC with hash-
conditioned global parameters scales to real-world
scenes.
This dual methodology allows us to explore the trade-off
between per-instance precision and global scalability. Our
key contributions are summarized as follows:
• Bloch Sphere Directional Encoding: We propose a
novel embedding that maps viewing directions onto
qubit states, yielding a physically meaningful represen-
tation of anisotropic reflections.
• Dual Quantum Control Mechanisms: We develop
two complementary schemes for modulating the pa-
rameters of VQCs through a classical hypernetwork or
through global conditioning, enabling a controllable
balance between local accuracy and large-scale gener-
alization.
• Enhanced View-Dependent Rendering: We show
that our quantum–hybrid framework achieves im-
proved expressivity and generalization, consistently
surpassing conventional 3DGS and other classical base-
lines.

Modeling
3DGS (Kerbl et al., 2023) relies on low-order Spherical
Harmonics (SH), which inherently act as a low-pass
filter, failing to capture sharp specularities. While hybrid
extensions like VDGS (Malarz et al., 2025) introduce MLP
modulation to mitigate this, they remain constrained by the
limited expressivity of classical networks in low-parameter
regimes, often resulting in blurred reflections for highly
anisotropic materials.
Quantum Neural Rendering
Despite rapid advances in
Quantum Machine Learning (QML), its application to 3D
neural rendering remains largely unexplored. The few pi-
oneering works primarily target implicit scene representa-
tions.
Quantum Radiance Fields (QRF) (Yang & Sun, 2023) (2023)
replaced NeRF (Mildenhall et al., 2020), MLPs with Param-
eterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs) and quantum activation
functions, enabling better capture of high-frequency details
via higher-order derivatives. The authors further introduced
quantum volume rendering via Grover’s search to accel-
erate ray integration. However, QRF prioritized compu-
tational efficiency in numerical integration over modeling
view-dependent geometric effects.
Quantum-Enhanced Gaussian Splatting
Recent re-
search has shifted alongside the broader community from
implicit NeRFs to explicit 3DGS (Kerbl et al., 2023).
QKAN-GS (Fujihashi et al., 2025) introduced Quantum
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (QKANs) with learnable
QReLU activations at network edges, enabling compact
representations of Gaussian attributes (opacity, covariance)
with significantly fewer parameters than classical counter-
parts. Their approach emphasized storage efficiency rather
than physically-motivated view-dependent appearance mod-
eling.
Differentiation
While QKAN-GS demonstrates the util-
ity of quantum networks for compression and attribute gen-
eration, it treats quantum layers primarily as parameter-
efficient function approximators for static attributes. In
contrast, QuantumGS addresses a fundamentally different
challenge: modeling complex, view-dependent light-matter
interactions. Unlike prior works that use quantum circuits
merely as drop-in replacements for classical neurons, Quan-
tumGS explicitly leverages quantum state space geometry.
By mapping viewing directions directly to the Bloch sphere,
it exploits qubits’ natural rotational properties to model
anisotropic effects and transparency, aspects unexplored by
QRF or QKAN-GS.
3. QuantumGS: Quantum Encoding
Framework for Gaussian Splatting
To overcome the limitations of classical neural networks
in modeling complex, high-frequency view-dependent ef-
fects, we introduce QuantumGS, a hybrid framework that
preserves the efficient 3D geometry of Gaussian Splatting
while delegating light-matter interactions to a quantum neu-
ral network. Unlike traditional methods that treat viewing
directions as discrete Euclidean coordinates, our approach
embeds them directly into the Bloch sphere of a multi-qubit
Hilbert space. This quantum-native representation captures
rotational continuity, phase relationships, and interference
effects to enable more expressive modeling of transparency,
anisotropic reflections, and specular highlights, while re-
maining compatible with spherical harmonic color represen-
tations.
The QuantumGS architecture is illustrated schematically in
Fig. 2. Below, we describe its methods and components in
detail.

3.1. Gaussian Splatting
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) (Kerbl et al., 2023) repre-
sents a scene as a collection of anisotropic 3D Gaussians
G = {(N(µ, Σ), α, c)},
(1)
where each Gaussian is defined by its mean (center) µ,
covariance Σ = RSSR⊤(with rotation R and scaling
S), opacity α, and color c. To model view-dependent ap-
pearance, colors are represented as functions of viewing
direction d via Spherical Harmonics (SH) (Fridovich-Keil
et al., 2022; Müller et al., 2022):
c(d) =
X
ℓ,m
aℓ,m Y m
ℓ(d),
(2)
enabling 3DGS to efficiently capture simple angular de-
pendencies. Rendering projects 3D Gaussians onto the im-
age plane and composites them via alpha blending (Yifan
et al., 2019). Recent improvements like VoD-3DGS (Nowak
et al., 2025) and VDGS (Malarz et al., 2025) extend view-
dependence to opacity α(d), using learnable symmetric
matrix (VoD-3DGS) or MLP modulation (VDGS) for en-
hanced realism.
While this formulation provides real-time performance and
robust geometric reconstruction, the spherical harmonic
basis remains limited for modeling high-frequency, view-
dependent, or specular effects. To overcome this, we intro-
duce a quantum embedding mechanism that maps classical
directional inputs into a continuous, rotation-aware quan-
tum feature space.
3.2. Quantum Encoding of Viewing Direction
Classical approaches typically represent viewing directions
as points in 3D Cartesian coordinates. However, such repre-
sentations fail to capture the continuous rotational topology
and the underlying SO(3) symmetry inherent to angular
data defined on the unit sphere.
Quantum systems overcome this limitation by mapping a
normalized viewing direction d = [dx, dy, dz] ∈S2 ⊂R3
onto the Bloch sphere, which is the geometric representation
3

QuantumGS
of pure single-qubit states in the complex Hilbert space H2.
This mapping yields the Bloch coordinates:
θ = arccos(dz),
ϕ = arctan(dy, dx),
(3)
with periodic normalization:
ϕ = (ϕ + 2π) mod 2π,
(4)
which we call viewing angles. The corresponding qubit
state admits the canonical Bloch-sphere parameterization:
|ψ⟩= α |0⟩+β |1⟩= cos
θ
2

|0⟩+eiϕ sin
θ
2

|1⟩, (5)
where |α|2 and |β|2 encode the probabilistic latitude of the
state, while eiϕ determines its azimuthal phase (longitude).
This formulation establishes a diffeomorphic mapping that
faithfully preserves the manifold structure of S2.
For practical implementation, we extend this to a 3-qubit
system (H⊗3
2 ) using rotation gates:
|ψenc⟩=
2
O
j=0
R(j)
z (ϕ) R(j)
y (θ) |0⟩⊗3 ,
(6)
where R(j)
y (θ) = exp(−i θ
2Y ) encodes the polar (latitude)
component and R(j)
z (ϕ) = exp(−i ϕ
2 Z) sets the azimuthal
(longitude) phase for the j-th qubit (Y and Z denote Pauli
matrices1). This encoding enables the network to inter-
pret viewing directions as continuous rotations, providing
a richer and more physically consistent basis for modeling
light–surface interactions compared to discrete directional
inputs used in standard NeRFs or VDGS frameworks.
3.3. Variational Quantum Circuit
The Bloch-encoded viewing direction |ψenc⟩is processed
through a Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) ansatz
U(θ; L) consisting of L layers (L = 4) parametrized by
rotation angles θ = (θj,ℓ, ϕj,ℓ)2,L
j=0,ℓ=1, designed to intro-
duce entanglement and trainable non-linearities. Each layer
alternates between single-qubit rotations and multi-qubit
entanglement to learn expressive, view-dependent transfor-
mations of the directional encoding.
Formally, the ℓ-th layer U (ℓ)(θℓ) of the ansatz, where θℓ=
(θj,ℓ, ϕj,ℓ)2
j=0 collects all its trainable parameters, applies
the following sequence to the 3-qubit register:
1. Parameterized Rotations: For the j-th qubit (j =
0, 1, 2), local rotations
Rj(θj,ℓ, ϕj,ℓ) = R(j)
z (ϕj,ℓ)R(j)
y (θj,ℓ)
(7)

and Z =

are applied. These layer-specific angles learn how
different viewing directions transform the initial Bloch-
sphere encoding.
2. Circular Entanglement: A cyclic CNOT sequence
Uent = CNOT0→1 CNOT1→2 CNOT2→0
(8)
entangles all three qubits, creating correlations that
model interdependencies between color channels
(RGB) and opacity. This ring topology ensures view-
dependent effects emerge from the joint quantum state.
The full ansatz transformation is thus provided by the fol-
lowing formula:
|ψout⟩= U(θ; L)|ψenc⟩= U (L)(θL) · · · U (1)(θ1)|ψenc⟩,
(9)
where
U (ℓ)(θℓ) = Uent
2
O
j=0
Rj(θj,ℓ, θj,ℓ).
(10)
Computational basis measurements of the output state
|ψout⟩in the Z-basis (the standard (|0⟩, |1⟩) basis of
quantum hardware) yield expectation values ⟨Zj⟩for
all qubits.
The resulting 3D quantum feature vector
(⟨Z0⟩, ⟨Z1⟩, ⟨Z2⟩) ∈[−1, 1]3 encodes nonlinear, entan-
gled correlations from VQC processing and feeds into a
lightweight classical MLP, yielding view-dependent refine-
ments ∆c(d) and ∆α(d) to the Gaussian’s base color (SH)
and opacity.
This yields a hybrid Quantum-MLP (QMLP) architecture,
illustrated in the bottom part of Fig. 2, which combines
quantum-native directional encoding with efficient 3DGS
rasterization.
3.4. Dual-Pipeline Framework: Local vs. Global
Modeling
QuantumGS employs two complementary pipelines balanc-
ing per-Gaussian expressivity with scene-scale scalability.
Pipeline I: Per-Gaussian Hyper-Quantum Modeling
A
hypernetwork H generates unique VQC parameters (the
rotation angles) θG and MLP weights W MLP
G
for each Gaus-
sian G ∈G from its hashed position µG:
(θG, W MLP
G
) = H(hash(µG)).
(11)
These spatially-adaptive VQC parameters configure the per-
Gaussian ansatz U(θG; L), maximizing local precision for
intricate optical effects like specular highlights on curved
surfaces. This approach excels for synthetic scenes priori-
tizing high PSNR.

“floater” artifacts beneath the model. QuantumGS generates a clean background comparable to ground truth. Bottom: In the Room scene
(Mip-NeRF 360), standard 3DGS struggles with geometric consistency at the bookshelf base, creating jagged artifacts. QuantumGS
eliminates these errors, preserving straight lines and structural coherence.

Using Pipeline I (Hyper-Quantum), QuantumGS achieves state-
of-the-art performance with the highest PSNR (33.98) and SSIM
(0.970) among all baselines, including standard 3DGS and VDGS.
These results confirm the efficacy of Bloch sphere mapping and
spatially-adaptive VQCs for modeling complex geometries and
high-frequency specular effects.

Pipeline II: Joint-Hash Global Modeling
For large-scale
real-world scenes, a shared VQC with global parameters θ
is conditioned on concatenated hash encodings of Gaussian
positions hashmean(µ) and viewing directions hashvdir(d).
The quantum circuit serves as a scene-wide light field ap-
proximator with superior memory scaling while preserving
quantum-enhanced view-dependent modeling. The output
is then processed by a shared MLP with global weights
W MLP.
3.5. Differentiable Rendering and Optimization
Final Gaussian attributes apply QMLP-generated view-
dependent multiplicative updates to base SH color and opac-
ity:
cfinal(d) = c(d)·∆c(d), αfinal(d) = α(d)·∆α(d). (12)
These refined attributes feed into a differentiable Gaussian
rasterizer for efficient 2D rendering from 3D primitives. The
full pipeline optimizes end-to-end via a combined loss
L = (1 −λ)L1 + λLD-SSIM,
(13)
which is scaled with a hyperparameter λ ∈(0, 1). Training
discovers optimal Bloch sphere rotations that eliminate view-
dependent artifacts while faithfully reproducing complex
scene radiance.
Experiments
In this section, we present numerical experiments validating
the effectiveness of our proposed QuantumGS framework.
Evaluations were conducted on standard datasets, including:
(a) the widely used NeRF Synthetic dataset for novel view
synthesis (NVS) (Mildenhall et al., 2020), and (b) large-
scale real-world scenes from Tanks and Temples (Knapitsch
et al., 2017), Mip-NeRF 360 (Barron et al., 2022), and Deep
Blending (Hedman et al., 2018).
Quantitative Results
As shown in Table 1, QuantumGS
achieves state-of-the-art performance on NeRF Synthetic,
attaining the highest PSNR and SSIM among all baselines,
including 3DGS and its view-dependent extension VDGS.
Per-scene results are detailed in Table 4. Pipeline I consis-
tently outperforms baselines across synthetic scenes, con-
firming the efficacy of spatially adaptive VQC parameters
for complex geometries and high-frequency details.

For large-scale scenes using Pipeline II, results are summa-
rized in Table 2. QuantumGS demonstrates superior general-
ization, surpassing 3DGS and VDGS on Deep Blending and
Tanks and Temples in PSNR and SSIM. On Deep Blending,
substantial gains highlight its robustness to complex light-
ing and unbounded scenes. On Mip-NeRF 360, it achieves
top SSIM and LPIPS while matching PSNR, indicating
that quantum-geometric encoding captures details elusive
to spherical harmonics or MLP modulations.
Qualitative Results
Visual comparisons in Fig. 1 and
Figs. 3–5 highlight our quantum encoding’s advantages. In
the Truck scene (Fig. 1), standard 3DGS’s low-order spher-
ical harmonics act as a low-pass filter, blurring the back-
ground poster visible through the windshield; QuantumGS
recovers high-frequency view-dependent transparency and
structural details.
In object-centric scenes (Fig. 4), our method excels in mate-
rial definition. In the Drums scene, QuantumGS preserves
distinct reflection geometry on the surface, unlike VDGS’s
blurred approximation. In the LEGO scene, it recovers chas-
sis occlusion shadows and eliminates floating artifacts near
the roof seen in baselines.
Geometric robustness appears in Fig. 3. In the Ship scene,
QuantumGS eliminates distracting floaters beneath the
model that plague 3DGS. In the Room scene, it maintains
structural coherence at the bookshelf base, avoiding 3DGS’s
jagged artifacts.
For large-scale scenes (Fig. 5), QuantumGS better handles
complex lighting. In the Kitchen scene, it removes unnat-
ural haze around the LEGO object present in 3DGS. In Dr.
Johnson’s scene, it resolves high-dynamic-range window
lighting, reducing overexposure on the surrounding geome-
try compared to 3DGS.
Performance and Real-Time Rendering
Despite the
computational overhead of quantum circuit simulation on
classical hardware, QuantumGS maintains real-time ren-
dering speeds. The efficient 3-qubit VQC design (utilizing
lightweight matrix operations) successfully mitigates the
costs typically associated with complex quantum mechanics
simulation.
As shown in Tables 1 and 2, QuantumGS achieves frame
rates ranging from 10 to over 16 FPS on high-resolution
scenes. This demonstrates that the high expressivity of
Bloch-sphere encoding does not preclude interactive vi-
sualization, enabling practical applications requiring both
physical fidelity and responsiveness.
Implementation Details
The QuantumGS framework
was implemented using PyTorch and 3DGS CUDA kernels
for efficient rasterization. All experiments were conducted
on a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU. Optimization
used the Adam optimizer for 30,000 iterations, following
standard 3D Gaussian Splatting protocol.
Architectural Configurations
Both pipelines utilize
multi-resolution hash encodings with L = 16 levels, feature
dimension F = 2, and maximum hash table size T = 219.
• Pipeline I (Synthetic): The hypernetwork is a classi-
cal MLP with two hidden layers of 64 units, residual
connections, GeLU activation, and dropout. The final
decoding MLP is lightweight: input layer of size 3, sin-
gle hidden layer of 3 neurons, output layer of size Nout
(where Nout = 49 for full SH+opacity modulation, or
Nout = 1 for opacity-only variants).
• Pipeline II (Real-World): Projection networks follow-
ing spatial and directional hashgrids are MLPs with
2 hidden layers of 64 units outputting dimension 3.
The final global decoding MLP shares the lightweight
structure of Pipeline I.

Figure 4. Object-centric scenes. In the Drums scene, VDGS blurs the reflection on the drum surface, losing the geometric definition of the
reflected drum. QuantumGS preserves the distinct shape of the reflection. In the LEGO scene, VDGS exhibits floater artifacts near the
roof. Additionally, QuantumGS recovers occlusion shadows on the chassis, unlike standard 3DGS.
Hyperparameters and Training
Distinct training strate-
gies were employed for each pipeline to address differences
between object-centric synthetic data and large-scale envi-
ronments.
For Pipeline I, learning rates for both the spatial XY Z
hash grid and hypernetwork were set to 5 · 10−5. All other
optimization parameters followed the original 3D Gaussian
Splatting implementation.
For Pipeline II, adjustments ensured stability and memory
efficiency: densification gradient threshold was 5 · 10−4 to
prevent excessive primitive growth. Learning rates were:
spatial XY Z hash grid and shared directional encoder at
1·10−3; hybrid quantum network (VQC and decoding MLP)
at 7.5 · 10−3.
Ablation Study
Table 3 evaluates the contribution of in-
dividual components and architectural choices within the
QuantumGS framework on the NeRF Synthetic dataset.
First, we analyze the influence of base color representation.
The QuantumGS NO SH variant sets spherical harmonics
degree to 0 (leaving only RGB color vector per Gaussian),
while our model predicts color and opacity changes. The
performance drop compared to the full model indicates that
retaining SH as base representation provides crucial initial-

Next, we examine the scope of quantum modulation. In

handle color while the quantum network predicts only opac-

only color atop standard SH, leaving opacity unchanged.
While single-attribute modulation improves over baselines,

results, confirming synergy between quantum-enhanced ge-

QuantumGS resolves this issue, producing clear object boundaries. In the Dr. Johnson scene (Deep Blending), QuantumGS correctly
handles high-dynamic-range light entering through the window, while standard 3DGS produces unnatural overexposure and artifacts on
surrounding walls.
ometry and appearance.
Finally, we compare the two pipelines:
QuantumGS
GLOBAL MODEL (Pipeline II) vs. QuantumGS HYPER
(Pipeline I). As shown in Table 3, the hypernetwork ap-
proach (HYPER) achieves the highest fidelity on object-
centric synthetic scenes, validating per-instance quantum
control for maximum local expressivity.
4. Conclusions
In this work, we introduced QuantumGS, a novel framework
integrating explicit 3D rendering with Quantum Machine
Learning. By replacing classical view-dependent functions
with Variational Quantum Circuits and Bloch-sphere encod-
ing, we demonstrate that quantum-geometric representations
significantly outperform standard spherical harmonics for
high-frequency optical effects.
Our dual-pipeline strategy balances local precision and
global scalability: Pipeline I (Hyper-Quantum) achieves
state-of-the-art fidelity on synthetic specular objects;
Pipeline II (Joint-Hash Global) enables robust generaliza-
tion in unbounded real-world scenes. Despite the classi-
cal simulation overhead, QuantumGS maintains interactive
frame rates (10–16+ FPS), confirming the method’s viability.
This framework establishes a foundation for future neural
rendering engines transitioning to real quantum hardware.
Limitations
The primary limitation is the cost of sim-
ulating quantum entanglement on classical GPUs, which
currently prevents reaching the extreme rasterization speeds
of vanilla 3DGS. While future NISQ hardware could by-
pass this bottleneck, the hypernetwork currently introduces
higher optimization complexity than explicit coefficients.
Balancing quantum expressivity with training efficiency re-
mains a key focus for future work.

QuantumGS
A. Detailed Quantitative and Qualitative Results
In this appendix, we provide a per-scene breakdown of our quantitative metrics on the NeRF Synthetic dataset and present
additional visual comparisons to further substantiate the performance of QuantumGS across diverse scenarios.
A.1. Per-Scene Quantitative Analysis
Table 4 presents the detailed PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS scores for each individual scene in the NeRF Synthetic dataset.
QuantumGS demonstrates robust consistency, achieving the highest PSNR on 8 out of 8 scenes, surpassing both the original
3DGS and the hybrid VDGS baseline. Notably, on challenging scenes with complex geometry and transparency such as
Materials and Hotdog, our method shows significant improvements, validating the effectiveness of the proposed Pipeline I
(Hyper-Quantum) in modeling high-frequency view-dependent effects.

A.2. Additional Qualitative Comparisons
We provide extensive visual comparisons in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7.
Real-World Scenes (Fig. 6). On the Truck scene, standard 3DGS fails to resolve the reflections on the windshield, resulting
in a blurred appearance, while QuantumGS recovers specular details. In the Counter scene, our method better preserves the
sharpness of reflections compared to the baseline. In the Room scene, standard 3DGS exhibits blurring artifacts caused by
geometric "floaters," which are mitigated in our approach. Notably, in the Playroom scene (Deep Blending), QuantumGS
outperforms both 3DGS and VDGS in recovering fine details, such as the drawings on the chalkboard, which appear washed
out in competing methods.
Synthetic Scenes (Fig. 7). On the NeRF Synthetic dataset, both QuantumGS and VDGS significantly outperform standard
3DGS. Standard 3DGS struggles with glossy surfaces, producing artifacts on the Drums. It also exhibits characteristic

"white halo" artifacts near object boundaries in the Hotdog and Lego scenes. Furthermore, in the Ship scene, standard 3DGS
fails to model water reflections accurately, generating spiky Gaussian artifacts and white background bleeding. QuantumGS
effectively eliminates these artifacts, producing clean and sharp renders.
Figure 6. Additional qualitative comparisons on Real-World scenes. From top to bottom: Truck (Tanks&Temples), Counter (Mip-NeRF
360), Room (Mip-NeRF 360), and Playroom (Deep Blending). Standard 3DGS struggles with reflections (Truck, Counter) and produces
floaters (Room). QuantumGS consistently recovers fine details, such as the chalk drawings in the Playroom scene, surpassing both
baselines.

Figure 7. Additional qualitative comparisons on Synthetic scenes. From top to bottom: Drums, Hotdog, Lego, and Ship. Standard
3DGS exhibits visible artifacts, including blurred specular highlights on the drums, white halos around the hotdog and lego bulldozer, and
spiky geometry near the water surface in the ship scene. QuantumGS matches or exceeds the quality of VDGS, effectively eliminating
these high-frequency artifacts.
