Abstract—Significant progress has been made in low-light
image enhancement with respect to visual quality. However,
most existing methods primarily operate in the pixel domain or
rely on implicit feature representations. As a result, the intrinsic
geometric structural priors of images are often neglected. 2D
Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) has emerged as a prominent explicit
scene
representation
technique
characterized
by
superior
structural fitting capabilities and high rendering efficiency.
Despite these advantages, the utilization of 2DGS in low-level
vision tasks remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, LL-
GaussianMap is proposed as the first unsupervised framework
incorporating 2DGS into low-light image enhancement. Distinct
from conventional methodologies, the enhancement task is
formulated as a gain map generation process guided by 2DGS
primitives. The proposed method comprises two primary stages.
First, high-fidelity structural reconstruction is executed utilizing
2DGS. Then, data-driven enhancement dictionary coefficients
are rendered via the rasterization mechanism of Gaussian
splatting through an innovative unified enhancement module.
This design effectively incorporates the structural perception
capabilities
of
2DGS
into
gain
map
generation,
thereby
preserving edges and suppressing artifacts during enhancement.
Additionally, the reliance on paired data is circumvented
through
unsupervised
learning.
Experimental
results
demonstrate
that
LL-GaussianMap
achieves
superior
enhancement performance with an extremely low storage
footprint, highlighting the effectiveness of explicit Gaussian

I. INTRODUCTION
he recovery of high-quality images from degraded
visual signals remains a longstanding and challenging
fundamental
issue
in
numerous
fields
including
autonomous driving and security surveillance. In this context,
increasing attention has been given toward Low-Light Image
Enhancement (LLIE). This task aims to alleviate low
visibility, low contrast, and severe noise contamination
induced by insufficient illumination. High-quality image
restoration
is
essential
for
accurate
visual
perception.
Furthermore, it serves as a critical prerequisite for the robust
performance of high-level vision tasks [1-4].
Substantial
advancement
in
brightness
and
color
enhancement has been achieved in recent years by deep
learning-based
methods
including
Convolutional
Neural
Networks and Transformer architectures. These methods
typically learn complex mappings from large-scale datasets.
However, images are predominantly treated as discrete pixel
grids or are represented through implicit feature embeddings
by
these
methods
[5-26].
Consequently,
the
intrinsic
continuity and geometric structure priors of natural images
are frequently overlooked in pixel-domain processing. Edge
blurring and texture loss are often observed in extremely low-
light regions due to the absence of explicit structural guidance.
Furthermore, noise tends to be amplified or artifacts tend to
be generated during the enhancement process. In addition,
most high-performance models rely on strictly paired training
data. The acquisition of such data is particularly difficult in
real-world scenarios. As a result, the generalization capability
of these models is significantly constrained [5-9].
Deep learning paradigms based on unsupervised or semi-
supervised learning have received increasing attention to
circumvent the reliance on paired datasets [5,7-11,14-15,17-
18,20].
However,
mapping
models
in
both
traditional
Retinex-based methods and generative models are formulated
in discrete pixel domains. Consequently, continuous signals
are
not
effectively
constrained
during
learning.
More
importantly, these approaches fail to establish an effective
connection between explicit structural representation and
illumination enhancement.
2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) has recently emerged as an
effective explicit scene representation technique in the field
of image compression [27-31]. This advantage stems from its
strong structural fitting capability and efficient rendering

mechanism. In contrast to implicit feature embeddings, Image
content is explicitly represented by 2DGS as a set of
adaptively optimized Gaussian primitives. Each primitive
encodes parameters including position, covariance, opacity,
and color. Such an explicit formulation enables high-fidelity
reconstruction of geometric image structures. Furthermore,
high computational efficiency is attained through a tile-based
rasterization process. Recent studies have leveraged the
strong structural modeling capability of 2DGS for low-level
vision tasks [32-35]. However, its direct application to low-
light image enhancement has not yet been explored.
To address this limitation, LL-GaussianMap is proposed as
the first zero-shot unsupervised framework that introduces 2D
Gaussian
Splatting
into
low-light
image
enhancement.
Distinct from existing methodologies, the low-light image
enhancement
process
is
reformulated
as
a
gain
map
generation problem guided by 2DGS primitives. The core
procedure of LL-GaussianMap comprises two tightly coupled
stages. First, high-fidelity structural reconstruction of the
input low-light image is performed using 2DGS, through
which intrinsic geometric structure information is accurately
captured. Subsequently, a unified enhancement module is
developed, where enhancement dictionary coefficients are
rendered through the 2DGS rasterization mechanism to
generate the final gain map. These coefficients are learned in
a data-driven manner and exhibit high compatibility with the
reconstructed structure. This two-stage design yields two key
advantages.
First,
the
geometric
structure
explicitly
represented by 2DGS is directly exploited to guide gain map
generation. Consequently,
edge sharpness is effectively
preserved, and artifact generation is suppressed during the
enhancement process. Second, a zero-shot unsupervised
paradigm is adopted for training the entire framework,
thereby completely eliminating reliance on paired supervised
datasets. As a result, both the generalization capability and
practical applicability of the model are substantially enhanced.
The effectiveness of the proposed LL-GaussianMap is
evaluated through extensive experiments on multiple public
benchmark datasets for low-light image enhancement. The
results demonstrate that LL-GaussianMap produces enhanced
images
with
superior
visual
quality,
while
effectively
retaining fine details and suppressing artifacts. Moreover, its
performance
exceeds
that
of
numerous
state-of-the-art
unsupervised methods as well as conventional schemes. More
importantly,
this
study
confirms
the
effectiveness
and
potential of explicit Gaussian representations for image
enhancement, thereby providing new perspectives for future
low-level vision studies.
The main contributions of this work are summarized as
follows:

LL-GaussianMap is presented as the first zero-shot
unsupervised framework that integrates 2D Gaussian
Splatting into low-light image enhancement. The
enhancement task is formulated as a gain map
generation problem guided by Gaussian primitives.

A unified enhancement framework is developed by
leveraging
the
explicit
structural
reconstruction
capability
of
2DGS.
Data-driven
enhancement
dictionary coefficients are rendered through the
Gaussian
rasterization
mechanism,
enabling
structure-aware enhancement with effective edge
preservation and artifact suppression.

LL-GaussianMap adopts an unsupervised learning
paradigm, thereby eliminating the dependence on
paired
training
datasets.
Extensive
experimental
evaluations further verify the effectiveness of explicit
Gaussian representations in image enhancement tasks.
II. RELATED WORKS
LL-GaussianMap lies at the intersection of explicit neural
representations and low-level vision tasks, with a particular
focus on the use of Gaussian splatting representations for
low-light image enhancement. Accordingly, related works are
organized into two main categories. First, recent progress in
low-light image enhancement is reviewed. Second, existing
studies
on
Gaussian
splatting
and
its
representative
developments are discussed.
A. Deep Learning-Based Low-Light Image Enhancement
Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve
the visual quality of images captured under low-illumination
conditions. It restores brightness, contrast, and fine details
while simultaneously suppressing noise and artifacts. This
task plays a critical role in various image preprocessing
pipelines. Early studies in this field date back to the 1960s,
during
which
traditional
methods
such
as
Histogram
Equalization and Retinex theory dominated. With the advent
of Convolutional Neural Networks, deep learning-based
approaches
have
substantially
improved
enhancement
performance, and have gradually become the mainstream
direction in recent research.
Early deep learning-based studies primarily relied on fully
supervised learning paradigms, where end-to-end training
was performed using strictly paired datasets. For example,
Chen et al. proposed FMR-Net and FRR-Net to capture
multi-scale features [12-13], and further enhanced feature
representation through complex residual network designs.
However,
fully
supervised
methods
face
two
major
challenges. First, acquiring high-quality paired data is costly,
and data collection remains difficult in real-world scenarios.
Second, a noticeable domain gap exists between synthetic
data and real degraded images, which limits the practical
effectiveness of these models.
To reduce dependence on paired datasets, recent studies
have increasingly shifted toward unsupervised and zero-shot
learning paradigms. Jiang et al. introduced EnlightenGAN,
which pioneered the application of Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) to low-light image enhancement by
enabling domain-adaptive enhancement with unpaired data
[11]. Subsequently, Guo et al. and Li et al. proposed Zero-
Reference Deep Curve Estimation (Zero-DCE) and its
improved
variant
Zero-DCE++
[7-8].
These
methods
dynamically adjust exposure by iteratively estimating pixel-

<!-- page 3 -->

wise high-order curves, without requiring reference images.
Such approaches have substantially advanced unsupervised
low-light image enhancement. Building upon this line of
work, Pan et al. incorporated Chebyshev approximation
theory to improve the robustness of curve estimation [15].
Beyond curve-based methods, recent progress has also been
reported in self-supervised
learning. Fu
et al. learned
lightweight enhancement models using paired low-light
image instances, and achieved competitive performance [17].
Zhang et al. proposed a noise autoregressive paradigm, which
jointly optimizes denoising and enhancement without relying
on task-specific data [18]. In addition, Shi et al. presented a
zero-shot illumination-guided framework (ZERO-IG) [20],
enabling adaptive enhancement and joint denoising in an
effective manner.
Purely data-driven methods have demonstrated strong
effectiveness, but often lack physical interpretability due to
their end-to-end nature. To address this issue, deep unfolding
techniques have been developed to integrate physical models
with the learning capacity of deep networks. Wu et al.
proposed URetinex-Net [19], which unfolds the Retinex
decomposition model into a deep network with implicit
regularization. Liu et al. designed an unfolding network based
on
architecture
search,
allowing
atomic
priors
to
be
discovered automatically [10]. In addition, Zheng et al.
proposed an unfolding-based deep network derived from
Total Variation minimization, which enforces fidelity and
smoothness constraints and enhances model interpretability
and robustness [14].
Lightweight architectures and real-time performance have
emerged
as
critical
priorities
in
resource-constrained
scenarios, such as mobile devices and autonomous driving
systems. Bai et al. and Chen et al. developed minimalist
architectures tailored for mobile and embedded platforms
[5,21], with fewer than 200 learnable parameters in a single
model. Moreover, Ma et al. introduced the Self-Calibrated
Illumination (SCI) framework [9], which employs cascaded
illumination learning and weight sharing. A self-calibration
module is further incorporated to accelerate convergence,
enabling efficient, flexible, and robust image enhancement.
In recent years, generative diffusion models and implicit
neural representations have brought renewed interest to low-
light image enhancement (LLIE). LightenDiffusion and
Aglldiff leverage the strong generative priors of diffusion
models
to
enable
unsupervised
high-quality
image
reconstruction [22-23], thereby alleviating over-smoothing
and texture degradation. At the same time, Yang et al. and
Chobola et al. investigated the use of implicit neural
representations for image enhancement tasks. By modeling
images as continuous functions, these approaches achieve
resolution-agnostic and context-aware enhancement, offering
an alternative solution for processing low-light images at
arbitrary resolutions [25-26].
B. Gaussian Splatting
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is widely regarded as a
milestone in explicit radiance field representation, driving
substantial
progress
in
novel
view
synthesis
and
3D
reconstruction in recent years [27]. Unlike Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF), which rely on implicit coordinate-based
mappings, 3DGS represents scenes using anisotropic three-
dimensional
Gaussian
ellipsoids
as
explicit
geometric
primitives. Differentiable tile-based rasterization is further
incorporated, enabling real-time rendering while preserving
high-fidelity
visual
quality.
This
explicit
and
efficient
representation has attracted considerable attention, leading to
extensions
across
a
wide
range
of
complex
scene
reconstruction tasks.
In autonomous driving and dynamic scene modeling,
Gaussian
primitives
have
been
employed
to
represent
dynamic urban environments and moving vehicles. Through
the integration of world models, several studies have explored
the generation and reconstruction of four-dimensional driving
scenes [36,41-42,46-47]. To address challenges associated
with large-scale environments and reconstruction efficiency,
multiple extensions of 3DGS have been proposed. By
introducing multi-view stereo geometric priors, momentum-
based self-distillation, and block-level parallel rendering
strategies, 3DGS has been successfully scaled to city-level
scenarios
[38,44-45],
resulting
in
reduced
memory
consumption and improved computational efficiency.
Other studies focus on accelerating reconstruction under
sparse input conditions, with training efficiency further
improved through progressive propagation strategies [37,43].
Beyond reconstruction, the application scope of 3DGS has
expanded to text-to-3D content generation, spatiotemporal
ballistic motion reconstruction, and scene enhancement under
low-light conditions. These efforts collectively demonstrate
the versatility and robustness of 3DGS in handling complex
three-dimensional data [35,39-40,48].
Motivated by the strong capability of 3D Gaussian
Splatting
(3DGS)
in
modeling
complex
geometry
and
textures, recent studies have explored its dimensionality
reduction for two-dimensional image representation tasks,
with
the
aim
of
replacing
traditional
implicit
neural
representations. The 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) paradigm
was first introduced by GaussianImage [30], which represents
images as collections of two-dimensional Gaussian primitives.
This formulation enables ultra-fast image encoding and
decoding speeds exceeding 1000 FPS together with high
compression ratios, while demonstrating the potential to
outperform coordinate-based neural networks. Subsequent
works further investigated the performance limits of 2DGS
across different image resolutions and representation scales.
Instant GaussianImage proposed an adaptive representation
framework with improved generalization capability [29]. LIG
focuses on high-resolution image modeling and introduces a
hierarchical 2DGS strategy, effectively addressing fine-
grained representation for large-scale images [28]. Beyond
pure image fitting, the efficient parameterization of 2DGS has
been extended to dataset distillation, where sparse Gaussian
representations substantially reduce data storage requirements
[31]. Compressed 2DGS-based image representations have

Fig. 1. Overall architecture of the proposed LL-GaussianMap framework. The framework introduces a novel enhancement paradigm that integrates explicit
geometric representation with data-driven manifold priors. The pipeline consists of three main stages: 1) the input low-light image is represented as a set of
discrete 2D Gaussian primitives, whose geometric parameters are subsequently frozen as spatial anchors; 2) a compact enhancement dictionary composed of
typical illumination transformation atoms is constructed offline from large-scale data; 3) a lightweight network predicts dictionary mixing coefficients for each
Gaussian primitive, and a structure-aware continuous gain map is generated through differentiable rasterization of the weighted atoms. The final enhanced image
is obtained by applying the gain map to the input image via pixel-wise multiplication.
also been employed to improve the efficiency of multimodal
models in vision–language alignment tasks [32]. Collectively,
these studies establish 2DGS as an efficient, compact, and
differentiable
image
representation
for
computational
photography and fundamental computer vision applications.
Inspired by the success of GaussianImage, the continuity
and
differentiability
of
Gaussian
functions
have
been
increasingly leveraged to address low-level vision problems.
Unlike
conventional
CNN-based
or
Transformer-based
approaches, 2DGS-based methods model image signals as
explicitly parameterized continuous functions. In the field of
image super-resolution, GaussianSR and Pixel-to-Gaussian
pioneer
the
use
of
2DGS
to
achieve
arbitrary-scale
reconstruction [33-34]. These methods learn mappings from
image pixels to Gaussian distributions, thereby avoiding
artifacts introduced by traditional interpolation schemes.
Benefiting from the high degree of parallelism in Gaussian
rasterization,
a
favorable
trade-off
between
inference
efficiency and reconstruction fidelity is achieved. These
findings indicate that 2DGS extends beyond a static image
storage format, acting as a dynamic computational primitive
with powerful generative and restorative capabilities, and
providing novel solution paradigms for image restoration and
enhancement.
III. PROPOSED METHOD
The proposed LL-GaussianMap framework is described in
this section, with its overall architecture shown in Fig.1. The
framework consists of three main components. First, multi-
scale explicit 2D Gaussian radiance fields are constructed to
capture fine-grained geometric structures within the scene.
Second, illumination enhancement primitives are learned
from large-scale datasets in an unsupervised manner, forming
a
data-driven
manifold-based
enhancement
dictionary.
Finally, a structure-aware unified enhancement module is
proposed, in which frozen Gaussian parameters are used as
geometric priors to adaptively fuse dictionary atoms and
render them across the spatial domain, achieving precise
pixel-level enhancement.
A.
Explicit 2D Gaussian Radiance Fields Construction
To obtain accurate geometric and texture representations
for subsequent enhancement, the input low-light image ����∈
ℜ�×�×3is explicitly reconstructed using a set of discrete 2D
Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) primitives. Unlike implicit neural
representations (INR), 2DGS enables direct modeling and
manipulation of geometric attributes in the image space. The
image plane is represented as a continuous radiance field
composed of individual two-dimensional Gaussian kernels.
Each Gaussian primitive ��is parameterized by a center
position ��∈ℜ2 , covariance matrix
�∈
σ
ℜ2×2 , and color
coefficients��∈ℜ3. For a pixel location �∈ℜ2, the response
value of the i Gaussian primitive ��is defined as:
���= exp −

�
−1 �−��
σ
.

To ensure the semi-positive definiteness and physical
interpretability of the covariance matrix

into the product of a scaling matrix and a rotation matrix:

(2)
where �denotes the rotation angle, and ��, �y denote the
scaling factors along the two principal axes. For image
rendering, a sort-based volumetric rendering approximation is
employed, commonly referred to as the splatting process. For
an arbitrary pixel location x, the reconstructed color �መ�
is
obtained by accumulating contributions along the depth order:
�መ�=

(3)
where ��denotes the opacity coefficient, and Q represents the
set of Gaussian primitives covering pixel �, sorted by depth.
To capture full-spectrum information spanning from low-
frequency illumination to high-frequency textures, the direct
optimization of a single-resolution Gaussian field is avoided.
Instead, an efficient multi-scale reconstruction paradigm
inspired by the LIG framework is adopted [28]. The number
of pyramid levels is denoted by �, and Gaussian primitives
are hierarchically optimized at resolutions
��, ��
�=0
�−1.The
reconstruction target at scale �, denoted as ��arg��
�
, is defined
as the residual from the previous level:
��arg��
�

if �= 0,
���
�−��������↑�መ�−1
if �> 0.
(4)
where �መ�−1 represents the cumulative reconstruction obtained
from the preceding �−1 levels. At scale �, the Gaussian
parameter set ��= �, �, ��is optimized by minimizing the
following photometric loss:
����
�= 1 −�
�መ�−��arg��
�
1 +

(5)
The final reconstructed image ����
is obtained via the
cascaded superposition of rendering results from all scales:
����=
�=0
�−1 �
σ
�������↑→0 �����������
.
(6)
Beyond achieving high-quality image reconstruction, this
stage crucially yields a set of frozen Gaussian parameters
denoted as � frozen = ⋃
���. These parameters provide precise
representations of image edges, textures, and geometric
structures, and are subsequently employed as structural priors
in the enhancement stage, thereby guiding the spatial
distribution of enhancement weights.
B. Data-Driven Manifold Enhancement Dictionary Learning
Traditional image enhancement methods often rely on
fixed mathematical models such as Retinex and Histogram
Equalization or completely black-box end-to-end networks.
The former lacks flexibility, whereas the latter suffers from a
deficit in interpretability. To integrate the advantages of both,
a data-driven manifold enhancement dictionary is constructed
on a large-scale unsupervised dataset. Referring to the dataset
construction of ZeroDCE, the assumption is made that
complex non-linear illumination transformations can be
decomposed into a linear combination of a set of basic
transformation operators [7-8]. First, a parameterized pixel-
level transformation function ��; �
is defined, where v
denotes the pixel value and �∈ℛ�represents the parameter
vector. Inspired by classic image processing, a quadratic
curve model is adopted to fit illumination adjustments:

is designed to learn these parameters from data. This network
is denoted as ℰ�. Images I are taken as input and Global

network is aimed at making the brightness of the enhanced

Upon completion of the training phase, the network ℰ�is
executed on the entire dataset and a massive collection of

����
is acquired. These
vectors
constitute
the

the

model, a zero vector �0 = 0 is explicitly incorporated into the

C. Structure-Aware Gaussian Image Enhancement
The implementation of low-light image enhancement
utilizing the reconstructed explicit 2DGS geometric structure
�������
and the acquired enhancement dictionary D is
detailed in this section. The fundamental philosophy of LL-
GaussianMap
dictates
that
the
spatial
distribution
of
enhancement coefficients must be aligned strictly with the
physical structure of the image. To this end, the intrinsic
rendering capabilities of 2DGS are leveraged to generate the
enhancement map, rather than relying on traditional bilinear
interpolation.
Gaussian-guided
coefficient
inference
and
rasterization. A lightweight Convolutional Neural Network
H�
is designed to predict a spatially varying dictionary
coefficient index map, given an input low-light image ���. To
strike a balance between computational efficiency and feature
representation
capability,
a
compact
encoder-decoder
architecture
based
on
a
pre-trained
MobileNetV2
is
constructed, rather than employing the cumbersome standard
U-Net. Specifically, the first seven stages of the pre-trained
MobileNetV2 are extracted to serve as the feature extraction
backbone. The input image ���
is mapped into a deep
semantic feature tensor ����∈ℜ��×�'×�' by this backbone
network.
Considering
the
unique
nature
of
low-light
enhancement tasks where dark regions necessitate more
pronounced adjustments than bright areas, a brightness-
guided attention mechanism is introduced to modulate
encoder features. As illustrated in Fig.4, the grayscale
brightness map �∈ℜ1×�×�of the input image is calculated
first and an inverted attention mask ����= 1 −�
is
constructed to emphasize low-illumination regions. This
mask is resized via bilinear interpolation to match the spatial
resolution of the features ����. Subsequently, element-wise
multiplication is performed between the attention mask and
the encoded features. Thus, attention-modulated features �att
are obtained:
����= ����⊗Re size↓8 ����,
(11)
Where denotes element-wise multiplication. As illustrated
in Fig.4, feature responses in well-exposed regions are
suppressed effectively by this step, thereby directing the
network to focus on under-exposed details necessitating
restoration. Finally, a shallow Decoding Head is devised to
project features into the coefficient space. This component is
composed of two consecutive convolutional layers.
To map these low-frequency weights to the high-resolution
pixel space while maintaining edge sharpness, sampling ����
is performed utilizing the Gaussian positions ��from the
reconstructed explicit 2DGS geometric structure.
For the �
Gaussian point, its corresponding dictionary
mixing weight vector ��is expressed as:
��= ��������������, ��,  ��∈ℜ�+1,
(12)
where ��is normalized to the interval −1,1 . Subsequently, a
critical Coefficient Splatting is executed. By treating the
weight vector ��
of each Gaussian primitive as a color
attribute, the rendering process is performed via the Gaussian
rasterizer utilizing frozen geometric parameters �������. The
resulting
full-resolution
weight
map �∈ℜ�+1 ×�×�is
represented as follows:

(7), the spatially varying gain map ��
is obtained and
depicted in Fig. 6. The formula is expressed as:
��= 1 + ��.
(15)
Additionally, a bias term �∈ℜ3
predicted by global
features is introduced to address global color deviation and
black level offset. The final enhanced image ���ℎ����
is
represented as:
�����= ����������⊗��+ �.

Hybrid loss function optimization. A comprehensive set
of loss functions is designed to train the enhancement
network H�effectively. Exposure control, spatial consistency,
sparsity constraints, and perceptual quality are encompassed
by this objective. First, global uniform brightness is not
enforced to address non-uniform illumination. Instead, local
targets are constructed based on Retinex theory. A local
adaptive target loss ��arg��is introduced:
��arg��= ����−���1,
(17)
where the target brightness is constructed by calculating the
input image brightness ����and its Gaussian blurred version
�����as follows:
���= ���������⋅
��arg��
�����+�.

this result.

dictionary atoms. Smooth variations are exhibited within homogeneous
regions. Simultaneously, sharp transitions are maintained at structural
boundaries. Local adaptive enhancement is realized by this spatially varying
gain field. Details in bright regions are preserved while dark regions are
enhanced significantly.
Simultaneously, consistency between the enhanced map
and the original image in the gradient domain is constrained
to preserve enhanced texture details. Consequently, a spatial
consistency loss ����is introduced, where ∇�, ∇�is defined as
the gradient operator:
����=
�∈{�,�}
​

σ
∇����ℎ����−∇�����∥1.
(19)
To suppress over-exposure and under-exposure, the local
mean value of the image is constrained. Thus, an exposure
consistency loss �exp is introduced. The image is partitioned
into ��patches ��of size 16×16. Subsequently, the average
intensity ��is calculated:

Ⅳ. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
A. Experimental Setup
Dataset. Two benchmark datasets are utilized to assess the
performance of the LL-GaussianMap model. Specifically, the
LOL dataset and the Large-Scale Real-World (LSRW)
dataset are selected [49-50]. LOL is established as the
premier public paired dataset meticulously constructed for
supervised learning tasks in low-light image enhancement.
The data comprises synthetically generated low-light images
alongside corresponding real-world normal-light images. As
the inaugural large-scale real-world paired dataset for low-
light and normal-light imagery, two independent subsets are
contained within LSRW. Images were acquired via a Huawei
P40 Pro smartphone and a Nikon D7500 digital SLR camera
respectively.
Implementation Details. The proposed structure-aware
enhancement network is implemented within the PyTorch
framework. All training and inference experiments are
conducted on a single NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU [51].
Parameter configurations and training strategies for both
stages
are
detailed
comprehensively
to
guarantee
experimental reproducibility. The proposed method adopts a
two-stage
optimization
paradigm
characterized
by
reconstruction followed by enhancement, conducting Zero-
Shot instance-level optimization for each individual input
image.
In the explicit geometric reconstruction of the first stage,
70,000
2DGS
primitives
are
initialized.
A
multi-scale
pyramid strategy �= 2
is adopted to capture geometric
details ranging from coarse to fine. The optimization employs
the Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.01. The
reconstruction process spans 20,000 iterations, with the
parameter �in the loss function ����configured as 0.7.
In the second stage, the Gaussian geometric parameters
�������learned in the first stage are frozen. Only the
parameters of the enhancement network are optimized. The
first seven layers of the pre-trained MobileNetV2 serve as the
feature extraction backbone, projecting feature dimensions to
32 via a 1 × 1 convolution. Simultaneously, the enhancement
dictionary is composed of �= 30
atoms learned via K-
Means
clustering
and
one
zero-transformation
atom.
Consequently, a total of 31 primitive channels are constituted.
During this phase, the enhancement network is trained for
a total of 30,000 iterations. The optimization utilizes the
Adam optimizer initialized with a learning rate of 0.001.
Furthermore, a cosine annealing scheduler is applied to
progressively attenuate the learning rate to 5% of its starting
magnitude. Based on empirical experiments and grid search,
Weight coefficients for each component in the total loss
function ������are set as follows : �1 = 0.01, �2 = 1, �3 =
6, �4 = 0.01, �5 = 3, �6 = 0.4.
Regarding
the
rendering
configuration,
a
tile-based
rasterizer is utilized for 2D Gaussian coefficient rendering
with the tile size set to 16 × 16 . To eliminate artifacts
stemming from convolution operations and tile boundaries,
reflection padding is applied during both feature extraction
and gradient calculation.
Evaluation Metrics. Seven widely recognized evaluation
metrics are selected in this study for the domain of image
restoration and enhancement. These metrics encompass three
Full-Reference (FR) indicators and four No-Reference (NR)
indicators. Three FR metrics are adopted to assess the
consistency between enhanced images and reference images
for
datasets
containing
paired
Ground
Truth
(GT).
Specifically, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural
Similarity (SSIM), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch
Similarity (LPIPS) are utilized. PSNR quantifies the pixel-
level fidelity of the enhanced image. SSIM assesses image
similarity across the three dimensions of luminance, contrast,
and
structure.
Meanwhile,
LPIPS
computes
perceptual
similarity by measuring the distance between the enhanced
and reference images within the feature space of a VGG-
based deep neural network.
To evaluate naturalness, contrast, and information content
in reference-free scenarios involving unpaired data or real-
world applications, this study employs four No-Reference
metrics including Natural Image Quality Evaluator (NIQE),
Lightness Order Error (LOE), Discrete Entropy (DE), and
Enhancement
Measure
Evaluation
(EME).
Specifically,
NIQE quantifies the degree of naturalness by measuring the
distance between the enhanced image and a statistical model
of natural images. LOE evaluates the capability to preserve
naturalness regarding lightness order. DE gauges the richness
of information contained within the image. EME relies on
Weber's Law to quantify local contrast variations.

B. Performance Comparison
To
ensure
the
fairness,
ten
state-of-the-art
(SOTA)
unsupervised methods in the LLIE domain are selected for
comparison with LL-GaussianMap [7-11,14-15,17-18,20].
Evaluation results on the LOL and LSRW datasets are
reported in Tables I and II respectively [49-50].
As illustrated in Fig.7, visual comparison results are
reported for images selected from the LOL, LSRW (Huawei),
and LSRW (Nikon) datasets. From the perspective of overall
brightness, LL-GaussianMap achieves the most faithful
brightness restoration among all compared methods. ZeroIG
produces images with brightness levels substantially higher
than those of the ground truth, whereas methods such as
ZeroDCE, EnlightenGAN, and UTV-Net exhibit noticeable
under-enhancement.With respect to color reproduction, LL-
GaussianMap maintains accurate color consistency without
observable color shifts. In contrast, global color deviations
are observed in methods including RUAS and EnlightenGAN.
In terms of contrast preservation, LL-GaussianMap yields
slightly higher contrast, while ZeroDCE, ZeroDCE++, and
ChebyLighter tend to produce lower-contrast results, which
leads to the loss of fine texture details. Overall, these visual
comparisons
demonstrate
that
LL-GaussianMap
delivers
competitive and well-balanced enhancement performance as
a newly developed low-light image enhancement framework.
To further evaluate the detail restoration capability of LL-
GaussianMap, more challenging scenes from the LSRW
dataset are examined in Figs.8 and 9. As shown in Figs.8,
LL-GaussianMap achieves accurate color reproduction and
preserves rich texture details. Although the overall brightness
remains slightly lower than that of the reference image, the
contrast is well maintained and fine structural details are
clearly retained. In Fig.9, a minor loss of highlight details is
observed. Nevertheless, the enhanced result produced by LL-
GaussianMap remains highly consistent with the ground truth
in terms of overall color appearance and contrast distribution.
These results indicate that LL-GaussianMap is capable of
delivering stable and visually coherent detail restoration even
in complex low-light scenarios.

for each method.
Fig. 9.Comparison of detailed features between LL-GaussianMap and SOTA methods on the LSRW dataset. Zoomed-in details within the red box are displayed
for each method.
For quantitative evaluation, both Full-Reference (FR) and
No-Reference (NR) image quality metrics are employed.
Specifically, PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS are adopted as FR
metrics, while NIQE, LOE, DE, and EME are used as NR
metrics. As reported in Tables I, II, and III, LL-GaussianMap
consistently ranks within the top two in terms of PSNR and
SSIM
across
all
four
datasets.
Moreover,
competitive
performance is also observed for the remaining evaluation
metrics, where the proposed method achieves strong overall
rankings.
Overall,
although
LL-GaussianMap
exhibits
certain
limitations, such as incomplete preservation of fine details in
some enhancement cases, it represents the first attempt to
introduce 2D Gaussian Splatting scene representation into
low-light image enhancement. Considering this novelty, LL-
GaussianMap
achieves
a
favorable
balance
between
enhancement quality and methodological innovation, and
demonstrates a clear performance advantage when compared
with a wide range of state-of-the-art methods.
C. Ablation Study
To
evaluate
the
effectiveness
and
contribution
of
individual
components
within
the
proposed
framework
comprehensively, a series of controlled ablation studies are
conducted. All ablation experiments are performed under
identical
dataset
splits
and
training
configurations.
Furthermore, the aforementioned evaluation metrics are
adopted as constant standards.
Analysis of Data-Driven Dictionary Construction. The
data-driven manifold dictionary serves as a critical bridge
connecting implicit illumination distribution with explicit
Gaussian geometry. The sampling density of the model
regarding the illumination manifold is determined by the size
of the dictionary. Comparative experiments are conducted by
setting K to {10,30,50,100}. As illustrated in Fig. 10, dense
weight maps Ωk corresponding to different cluster quantities
are displayed. It is evident that detailed textures increase
gradually as the value of K rises. Fragmentation in the overall
weight distribution emerges when K>30 . Consequently,
unnecessary computational overhead is induced. As presented
in TABLE IV, the best performance across all metrics is
achieved when K=30. Thus, K=30 is selected in this paper to
balance
representation
capability
and
computational
efficiency.
Complexity of Enhancement Curves. The degrees of
freedom of the atom-wise adjustment curve are controlled by
P, as defined in (7). This parameter determines the number of
learnable coefficients �1, �2…��assigned to each pixel or
dictionary atom for modulating its brightness adjustment
curve. Accordingly, �∈{1,2,3,5} is evaluated. As shown in
Fig. 11, finer texture details are progressively recovered as P
increases, and the performance stabilizes when �= 5 . As
reported in TABLE V, the best overall results across all
evaluation metrics are achieved at �= 5. Therefore, �= 5 is
adopted as the default parameter setting in this work.

Contribution of Loss Terms. The overall loss function
������
incorporates exposure control, spatial consistency,
sparsity regularization, and perceptual quality. To assess the
contribution of each component, ablation experiments are
conducted
by
removing
individual
loss
terms.
The
corresponding
quantitative
visual
comparisons
are
summarized in Fig.12. The results indicate that each loss
component plays a critical role in the enhancement process.
In particular, removing the exposure control loss �exp and the
spatial consistency loss �cont leads to noticeable brightness
degradation. When the total variation loss �tv is excluded,
pronounced color transition artifacts and an imbalance in
global contrast are observed.
Impact of Enhancement Iterations. A zero-shot learning
strategy is adopted, in which performance gains are obtained
through iterative optimization of illumination enhancement
parameters on a single image. The iteration number directly
affects optimization convergence and visual quality. To
analyze this effect, the model is evaluated systematically
under different iteration settings, including 5K, 10K, 20K,
50K, and 100K.As reported in TABLE VI, both brightness
restoration and detail clarity improve progressively as the

iteration count increases, reaching a maximum at 50K
iterations, after which a gradual degradation is observed. The
results indicate that 50K iterations achieve the best balance
between global brightness recovery and color fidelity. Further
analysis of TABLE VI shows that this setting yields the best
performance on most evaluation metrics. With the exception
of LOE and EME, all remaining metrics attain their highest
rankings at 50K iterations. Based on these experimental
findings,
50,000
iterations
are
adopted

the
default
configuration for the second-stage optimization.
D. Limitation and Future Works
Remarkable generalization capabilities and high-fidelity
visual effects have been demonstrated by LL-GaussianMap in
low-light enhancement tasks. Nevertheless, several avenues
warranting further exploration remain within this domain.
First, achieving a better balance between inference efficiency
and
reconstruction
quality
remains
an
open challenge.
Achieving real-time inference without degrading perceptual
quality has become an important research focus, motivated by

recent
advances
in
feed-forward
Gaussian
splatting
techniques. The currently adopted two-stage optimization
paradigm ensures instance-level adaptability for individual
images,
but
introduces
notable
computational
overhead
compared with pure inference-based models. Future work
may explore end-to-end network architectures to accelerate
the
prediction
of
Gaussian
geometric
parameters
and
enhancement coefficients, thereby enabling more efficient
deployment. Second, reconstructing intricate high-frequency
texture details using discrete Gaussian ellipsoids remains an
open challenge. Detail blurring may occur when extremely
fine textures are approximated with a limited number of
primitives, which stems from the inherent smoothing property
of Gaussian kernels. More expressive geometric primitives
will be investigated in future work, or frequency-domain
constraints will be incorporated to further improve high-
frequency reconstruction accuracy. Finally, LL-GaussianMap
is expected to facilitate the advancement of low-level vision
applications
within
the
compressed
2DGS
image
representation domain. Images are encoded as compact and
structured sets of 2D Gaussian primitives, which may enable
next-generation image processing algorithms that jointly
achieve storage efficiency and structural awareness.
V. CONCLUSION
LL-GaussianMap is presented as a pioneering Zero-Shot
unsupervised
framework
that
introduces
2D
Gaussian
Splatting into low-light image enhancement in this paper.
This framework addresses the inherent limitations of implicit
representations
in

and

priors. A data-driven manifold dictionary and a unified
enhancement module are jointly employed, enabling deep
integration of illumination modeling and explicit geometric
representation through differentiable Gaussian rasterization.
As a result, image edges are preserved effectively and natural
brightness restoration is achieved without reliance on paired
training data. Limitations in real-time inference efficiency
remain due to the current scene-wise optimization strategy.
Moreover,
geometric
robustness
under
extreme

conditions
requires
further
investigation.
Nevertheless,
extensive experimental results validate the strong potential of
explicit Gaussian representations in low-level vision tasks.
Future work will focus on developing feed-forward Gaussian
encoders
to
replace
iterative
optimization,
as
well
as
extending the proposed framework to joint denoising and
other image restoration tasks. These efforts are expected to
open new directions for image processing paradigms based
on explicit primitives.
