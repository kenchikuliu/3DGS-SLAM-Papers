GRMM provides disentangled control over a base 3DMM and learned residuals, fitting unseen identities from input images
and enabling novel view synthesis and expression editing while preserving identity. It produces photorealistic 1K-resolution full-head
renderings with diverse expressions in real time, achieving up to 75 fps. As part of this work, we also contribute EXPRESS-50, a dataset
of 50 identities with 60 distinct expressions aligned across subjects, enabling consistent modeling of expression residuals.
Abstract
3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) enable controllable fa-
cial geometry and expression editing for reconstruction,
animation, and AR/VR, but traditional PCA-based mesh
models are limited in resolution, detail, and photoreal-
ism. Neural volumetric methods improve realism but re-
main too slow for interactive use. Recent Gaussian Splat-
ting (3DGS) based facial models achieve fast, high-quality
rendering but still depend solely on a mesh-based 3DMM
prior for expression control, limiting their ability to capture
fine-grained geometry, expressions, and full-head coverage.
We introduce GRMM, the first full-head Gaussian 3D mor-
phable model that augments a base 3DMM with residual
geometry and appearance components, additive refinements
that recover high-frequency details such as wrinkles, fine
skin texture, and hairline variations. GRMM provides dis-
entangled control through low-dimensional, interpretable
parameters (e.g., identity shape, facial expressions) while
separately modelling residuals that capture subject- and
expression-specific detail beyond the base model’s capac-
ity. Coarse decoders produce vertex-level mesh deforma-
tions, fine decoders represent per-Gaussian appearance,
and a lightweight CNN refines rasterised images for en-
hanced realism, all while maintaining 75 FPS real-time
rendering. To learn consistent, high-fidelity residuals, we
present EXPRESS-50, the first dataset with 60 aligned ex-
pressions across 50 identities, enabling robust disentangle-
ment of identity and expression in Gaussian-based 3DMMs.
Across monocular 3D face reconstruction, novel-view syn-
thesis, and expression transfer, GRMM surpasses state-of-
the-art methods in fidelity and expression accuracy while
delivering interactive real-time performance.
1. Introduction
High-fidelity 3D face modelling is essential for VR, AR,
animation, and digital avatar creation. A widely used class
of methods, 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) [2, 10] com-
pactly and controllably represent facial geometry and ap-
pearance using low-dimensional parametric spaces. How-
ever, achieving photorealism, real-time efficiency, and ex-
pressiveness remains challenging, as current methods strug-
gle to capture fine details while maintaining real-time per-
formance. Traditional mesh-based 3DMMs [2, 3, 20, 46]
are efficient and interpretable but limited in resolution and
unable to represent fine-scale geometry and texture vari-
ation.
Neural rendering [12, 47] and volumetric meth-

ods [13, 14, 52] improve visual fidelity, but are computa-
tionally heavy and struggle with large deformations or ex-
treme expressions. More recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS)[15] has enabled high-resolution rendering at inter-
active rates. However, 3DGS-based facial models[45, 50]
still rely solely on coarse mesh-based 3DMM priors for ex-
pression control, limiting their expressivity and ability to
capture subtle, identity- or expression-specific detail. Fur-
thermore, these models are not publicly available.
An additional bottleneck is the scarcity of datasets with
both high expression diversity and cross-identity expres-
sion alignment. While recent datasets [19, 24, 25] improve
identity coverage, they typically provide limited expression
variability and lack the alignment required for disentangled
identity–expression learning.
To address these limitations, we propose the Gaussian
Residual Morphable Model (GRMM), the first open-source,
full-head 3D Gaussian morphable model with learned resid-
uals: additive refinements to both geometry and appearance
that recover high-frequency details such as wrinkles, skin
microstructure, and hairline variation beyond the capacity
of a base 3DMM. GRMM offers independent control over
(i) interpretable low-dimensional 3DMM parameters (iden-
tity shape, facial expression, head pose) and (ii) residual
parameters that encode fine-scale, identity- and expression-
specific deviations. This separation enables precise, compo-
sitional manipulation of facial attributes without sacrificing
realism (Figure 1).
Technically, GRMM is based on a mesh-based base
3DMM [20] to produce a coarse head shape and pre-
dicts residual deformations using lightweight MLPs driven
by low-dimensional identity and expression codes.
UV-
anchored Gaussian primitives deform coherently with the
mesh, preserving spatial consistency and cross-identity cor-
respondence. Convolutional decoders predict per-Gaussian
appearance for detailed geometry and texture, while an
image-space CNN refines rasterised images to recover sur-
face details not fully captured by the Gaussians. The result
is real-time 1K-resolution rendering at 75 FPS.
To support learning disentangled residuals, we introduce
EXPRESS-50, a multi-view dataset containing 50 identities
each performing 60 consistently aligned expressions. Ex-
pression alignment is achieved via over 150 hours of frame-
by-frame manual annotation, ensuring that all subjects ex-
hibit semantically matched expressions (including challeng-
ing motions such as tongue movement). This alignment en-
ables cross-identity supervision for robust residual disen-
tanglement and improves generalisation to unseen subjects
and expressions.
In summary, our contributions are:
• GRMM, the first open-source, full-head residual Gaus-
sian morphable model that achieves high expressivity,
fine-grained control, and real-time 1K rendering at 75
FPS, outperforming prior morphable face models in both
quality and flexibility.
• A novel architecture that separates base 3DMM control
from learned residual geometry and appearance, com-
bined with enhanced mesh topology and UV mapping that
explicitly models teeth and inner-mouth regions. Thus,
enabling high rendering quality, speed, and expressivity.
• EXPRESS-50, i.e., a new multi-view image dataset with
50 identities and 60 aligned facial expressions, extends
the corpus of existing datasets in the literature and serves
as an essential ingredient to obtaining the results demon-
strated in this paper.
2. Related Work
Mesh-based head models.
Parametric 3D face models
represent facial geometry, expression, and identity using
low-dimensional parameters. The seminal 3D Morphable
Model (3DMM) by Blanz and Vetter [2] aligns a fixed-
topology mesh to 3D scans through non-rigid registra-
tion and learns shape and appearance spaces via PCA [1].
Subsequent works [20, 40] introduced multilinear models
with separate control over facial components (e.g., jaw and
eyes), which have become standard priors for reconstruc-
tion and tracking [17, 35, 36]. FaceScape [46] improved
realism with high-resolution geometry and diverse expres-
sions, but mesh-based 3DMMs remain constrained by lin-
ear subspaces and limited expressiveness for fine details.
To overcome this, non-linear mesh 3DMMs [29, 38, 39]
use deep networks to learn complex mappings from latent
codes to mesh geometry, improving reconstruction quality
and facial variation. However, these models often act as
black boxes, sacrificing interpretability and editability, and
typically remain limited to facial regions without support-
ing full-head modelling. Delta models such as DECA [11]
and EMOCA [8] enhance detail with UV-space displace-
ments but remain restricted to the facial region.
Gener-
ative approaches, such as Morphable Diffusion [6], lever-
age diffusion models conditioned on 3DMMs to synthesise
avatars from a single image; however, they lack explicit
control over identity and expression, and cannot represent
the mouth interior or hair. Our method unifies the control-
lability of mesh-based 3DMMs with learned full-head per-
vertex deltas and 3D Gaussian refinement, thereby retaining
interpretability while capturing high-frequency details that
exceed the limits of linear or face-only models.
Implicit parametric head models.
Implicit representa-
tions have driven significant progress in neural parametric
head modelling. SDF-based methods [12, 47] avoid fixed
mesh topology and better capture complex structures like
hair. NeRF-based approaches [14, 42, 52] achieve photore-
alistic heads without explicit geometry, while hybrid tech-
niques [5, 13, 23] combine mesh priors with volumetric

<!-- page 3 -->
fields for improved controllability and realism, often using
large-scale capture datasets. However, NeRF-based models
suffer from low rendering efficiency, forcing trade-offs be-
tween quality and speed. In contrast, our method predicts
mesh-based deformations in a delta space and adds fine-
scale details using 3D Gaussians, enabling efficient render-
ing while preserving control and high-frequency detail.
3D Gaussians-based head representations.
3D Gaus-
sian splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful
approach for photorealistic novel-view rendering with real-
time performance [15, 41].
Initially developed for rigid
scenes, it has been extended to dynamic domains, including
human heads and faces. The 3D Gaussian Parametric Head
Model (GPHM) [45] adapts 3DGS for facial geometry by
representing the head with a dense set of Gaussians trained
on datasets such as NeRSemble [19] and FaceVerse [43],
achieving high-quality synthesis. However, GPHM relies
on MLP decoding, lacks a clear separation between coarse
geometry and fine detail, and relies on 3DMM fitting and
keypoints for reconstruction, which limits its expressive-
ness. HeadGAP [50] builds on FLAME with part-based
Gaussian offsets but remains constrained by FLAME’s fixed
topology and shape space, while also inheriting the MLP
overhead.
Furthermore, HeadGAP cannot sample new
identities or expressions, reducing its generative flexibil-
ity. Other re-enactment approaches, such as GAGAvatar [7]
and Portrait4D-v2 [9], use captured FLAME parameters but
can only replay observed motions. Despite these advances,
building a generative, expressive, and efficient head model
remains an open challenge. Our approach combines mesh-
based 3DMM control with full-head geometric deltas and
3D Gaussian refinement.
We utilise a lightweight MLP
for vertex geometry and convolutional decoders for per-
Gaussian parameters, thereby avoiding the need for heavy
per-Gaussian MLPs. This design reduces runtime, separates
coarse geometry from fine details, and allows for sampling
of identities and expressions.
Multiview
head
datasets.
Several
multiview
head
datasets have been developed to advance 3D head mod-
elling.
FaceScape [46] captures 938 subjects with 20
expressions
using
high-resolution
multiview
images,
primarily featuring East Asian identities and excluding
hair.
NeRSemble [19] comprises 300 identities in con-
trolled setups, offering good subject diversity but limited
expression coverage [27].
RenderMe-360 [25] captures
500 subjects with full 360-degree views, including complex
hairstyles and accessories, but offers only 12 expressions
per subject. AVA-256 [24] extends diversity by supporting
256 identities under consistent illumination and broad ex-
pression coverage, but it suffers from background matting
and unnatural colour distribution, which complicates 3D
reconstruction. Although these datasets improve diversity
and fidelity, they lack expression alignment across identi-
ties, which is critical for learning morphable models with
precise identity-expression control.
We complement these datasets with our EXPRESS-50
dataset, which provides expression alignment across 50 di-
verse identities. EXPRESS-50 captures a broader range of
expressions than existing datasets, ensuring consistent cor-
respondence across subjects. This alignment is essential for
learning expressive, identity-disentangled morphable mod-
els.
3. Method
We present GRMM, a real-time, high-fidelity full-head
morphable model that augments a mesh-based 3D Mor-
phable Model (3DMM) with learned geometry and appear-
ance residuals using 3D Gaussian splatting. Section 3.1 in-
troduces our new EXPRESS-50 dataset and the associated
preprocessing pipeline, which together form a key contribu-
tion enabling consistent expression alignment across iden-
tities. Section 3.2 outlines the Gaussian attributes, image
model, and camera model used to define the 3D representa-
tion and projection process. Section 3.3 describes the model
structure, and Section 3.4 details the training methodology.
Finally, Section 3.5 presents the inference process, includ-
ing refinement steps for full-head reconstruction.
3.1. Expression-Aligned Datasets
We use two datasets to train our model: EXPRESS-50, a
novel dataset we collected for complex facial expression
modelling, and RenderMe-360 [25], a publicly available
4D human head dataset. EXPRESS-50 was created to pro-
vide a rich and diverse set of high-intensity expressions,
complementing RenderMe-360’s broader identity coverage.
EXPRESS-50 contains 50 identities performing 60 distinct
expressions, recorded at 24 fps using a 24-camera FaceRig
at 3840×2160 resolution. RenderMe-360 features 500 sub-
jects performing 12 expressions, captured with 60 synchro-
nised cameras at a resolution of 2448×2048.
Preprocessing.
We preprocess both datasets through ex-
pression alignment, tracking, image preprocessing, and
depth generation. A key contribution is the manual align-
ment of expressions across identities, enabling better disen-
tanglement of identity and expression residuals in our mor-
phable model. Age and gender statistics for EXPRESS-50
are in the supplemental (Section 5), and we will publicly
release the dataset with annotations, expression labels, and
preprocessing outputs.
Expression Alignment.
We manually annotate peak ex-
pressions in the EXPRESS-50 and RenderMe-360 datasets

<!-- page 4 -->
to ensure consistent expression alignment across identities.
In EXPRESS-50, each subject follows a scripted sequence
of 60 expressions demonstrated via a reference video. For
a chosen reference identity, we manually select the frame
where each expression is most prominent to serve as the
canonical example.
For the remaining 49 identities, we
select the peak expression frame that best matches each
canonical frame, ensuring visual and semantic alignment
across subjects. In RenderMe-360, each of the 12 expres-
sions is provided as a short video sequence per identity. We
observe that the final frame in each sequence typically cap-
tures the peak of the intended expression, so we annotate
the last frame of each video as the aligned expression frame.
We use 280 RenderMe-360 identities for alignment, exclud-
ing those with heavy makeup or large accessories that inter-
fere with facial appearance. Together, these datasets com-
prise 330 unique identities, offering broad coverage of facial
shapes and expressions. Examples of consistent expression
alignment are included in the supplementary material.
Tracking.
To recover coarse facial geometry, we estimate
FLAME [20] parameters: neck pose θneck, jaw pose θjaw,
expression αexp, and identity αid. We adopt landmark- and
photometry-based tracking using VHAP [28] to fit FLAME
to annotated frames, obtaining a tracked mesh vrec, global
pose (R, t) per frame. For RenderMe-360 and EXPRESS-
50, 68 facial landmarks from [4] guide the tracking.
Ground-Truth Depth Generation.
To obtain high-
quality ground truth depth images Igt
depth for supervision,
we adopt ProbeSDF [37], a state-of-the-art surface recon-
struction method.
We apply it to each time step in our
dataset to raycast depth from the optimised 3D surface.
Image Preprocessing.
Foreground masks are extracted
with RMBG-2.0 [49] for RenderMe-360 and Background-
MattingV2 [21] for EXPRESS-50, while Sapiens [16] pro-
vides additional facial masks to remove the torso and focus
on the face.
3.2. Preliminaries
Image Generation Model.
We build upon 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) [15], where each primitive is parameter-
ized by position p, rotation r, scale s, opacity o, and color
c. Following RaDe-GS [48], we render depth from Gaus-
sian attributes, and further attach a learnable feature vector
fi ∈R32 to each primitive for richer mid-level appearance.
The complete attribute set is
B = {p, r, s, o, c, f},
Irgb, Idepth, Ifeature = R(B, πK,E),
(1)
where R is a differentiable rasterizer with camera intrinsics
K and extrinsics E. To ensure a consistent reference frame,
we transform cameras into the canonical FLAME space:
π′
R,t = K · E ·
R
t
,
(2)
where R, t are the tracked FLAME mesh orientation
and translation obtained from the preprocessing step Sec-
tion 3.1.
GaussianHeads.
Our GRMM method adapts the Gaus-
sianHeads (GH) [34] architecture, which maps primitives
to UV space of a template mesh.
Unlike GH, designed
for subject-specific reconstruction, our method generalizes
across identities and expressions with a different formula-
tion and training strategy. Given expression code zexp and
view direction d, GH predicts primitive attributes as
{vδ, δr, δp, δs, o, c} = DGH(zexp, d),
(3)
where vδ are mesh vertex deformations, {δr, δp, δs} are ro-
tation, translation and scale offsets relative to the template,
and o, c denote opacity and color.
3.3. Gaussian Residual Morphable Model
Our goal is to generate a high-fidelity head model for un-
seen identity and expression. Our method comprises a set
of decoders (Figure 2), DGRMM := {Φmesh, ΦT , Φα, Φapp}
and a refinement network Ψref. The mesh decoder Φmesh
predicts vertex deformations for vrec, the transform decoder
ΦT outputs Gaussian primitive transformations, the opacity
decoder Φα estimates primitive opacities, and the color de-
coder Φapp produces view-dependent appearance. All mod-
ules take as input the residual identity code zid, residual
expression code zexp, neck pose θneck, jaw pose θjaw, ex-
pression coefficients αexp, and view direction d, generating
a complete head model with photorealistic rendering.

.
(4)
The refinement network Ψref refines the rendered image
Irgb, which is obtained from Equation 1. Each component
is introduced in detail in the following sections.
Leveraging Expression Alignment.
We represent each
subject with a learnable residual identity latent code zid ∈
R512 and each facial expression with a learnable global ex-
pression residual latent code zexp ∈R256. Each expres-
sion is associated with a single zexp that is shared across all
identities. This design promotes a clear separation between
identity and expression residuals.
Mesh Decoder
The mesh decoder Φmesh predicts per-
vertex identity and expression displacements.
We use a
shared MLP before the decoder to fuse identity and pose

Figure 2. Method pipeline. Identity and expression latents zid ∈R512 and zexp ∈R256, together with FLAME pose/expression param-
eters (θneck, θjaw, αexp), drive the coarse mesh decoder Φmesh to predict per-vertex displacements vδ. Adding these to the tracked mesh
vrec yields the deformed mesh Md = (vd, F). UV-anchored 3D Gaussians with initial (pin, rin, sin) are placed on Md. The transfor-
mation decoder ΦT(zid, zexp) outputs UV-aligned maps δp, δr, δs to refine position, rotation, and scale; the opacity decoder Φα(zid) and
appearance decoder Φapp(zid, d) produce opacity, RGB, and a 32-D feature map. A differentiable rasterizer renders Irgb, Idepth, Ifeature,
where Idepth is normalized to Inorm
depth and provided as input to the screen-space CNN Ψref, which outputs the final RGB image I.
features, which improves conditioning and enables disen-
tangled geometry prediction. A shared MLP processes the
identity and pose inputs:
fbase = MLPshared([zid, θneck, θjaw]),
(5)
where zid
∈
R512 is the residual identity code, and
θneck, θjaw ∈R3 are pose parameters. Identity displace-
ments are predicted as:
vδ,id = Φmesh,id(fbase),
(6)
where vδ,id ∈RNv×3 and Nv is the number of mesh ver-
tices. FLAME expression modulation is applied to the con-
catenated identity–expression feature:
fexp = [fbase, zexp],
zexp ∈R256,
(7)
[γ, β] = MLPFiLM(αexp),
αexp ∈R100,
(8)
˜fexp = fexp + γ ⊙fexp + β,
(9)
where MLPFiLM outputs the scale γ ∈Rd and shift β ∈
Rd parameters for feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM).
Expression displacements are then computed as:
vδ,exp = Φmesh,exp(˜fexp).
(10)
The final deformed mesh is:
vd = vrec + vδ,id + Mface vδ,exp,
(11)
where Mface masks teeth vertices to prevent expression off-
sets. We add teeth vertices following VHAP and extend
FLAME with inner-mouth faces, forming Md = (vd, F),
where F is the face connectivity. FLAME enhancements
are provided and ablated in the supplemental material (Sec-
tion 7). Additionally, we ablate the importance of Φmesh
in Section 10.
Gaussian Primitive Initialisation.
We initialize Nprim =
N2
g 3D Gaussians by uniformly sampling the UV space of
the 3DMM mesh at a resolution of Ng×Ng, with Ng = 512.
Each Gaussian is assigned a position pin ∈R3 via barycen-
tric interpolation on the deformed mesh Md with vertices
vd, and both rotation rin ∈R3 and scale sin ∈R3 are ini-
tialized to zero. To model the mouth interior, we enhance
the FLAME UV map by defining separate UV regions for
the teeth and mouth interior. More details are provided in
the supplemental material (Section 7).
Decoding the Gaussian Primitive Attributes.
To enable
high-resolution real-time rendering, we decode the proper-
ties of each Gaussian using efficient CNN decoders. Fol-
lowing [26, 32], these decoders map identity and expression
codes (zid, zexp) to geometric and appearance attributes,
capturing fine transformations and view-dependent colour.
Transformation decoder ΦT maps zid and zexp to an
offset map of size Ng×Ng×10, corresponding to the offsets
of position (δp), rotation (δr) and scale (δs) for the initial
values pin, rin, and sin. The updated Gaussian parameters
are:
p = pin + δp,
r = δr,
s = δs.
(12)
Position offsets δp capture fine-scale surface variation, in-
cluding facial hair and inner-mouth geometry.

<!-- page 6 -->
Opacity decoder Φα predicts a map of size Ng×Ng×1,
where each value represents the opacity oi of a Gaussian
and is only conditioned on zid.
Appearance decoder Φapp predicts a map of size Ng ×
Ng × 35, where each entry contains RGB colour ci ∈R3×1
and a learned feature vector fi ∈R32×1; this decoder is
conditioned on zid and the view direction d.
Refinement Network.
We use a CNN in the screen space,
Ψref, to refine the rendered results. The image resolution re-
mains unchanged (1K) before and after refinement. Please
refer to our video for a clearer illustration. We also ablate
the importance of the refinement network in the supplemen-
tary material (Section 10). This refinement enhances ap-
pearance priors that are difficult to capture for our 3DGS-
based model without altering the underlying 3D representa-
tion, similar to the approaches in [44, 51].
[Irgb, Ifeature, Idepth] = R(B, π′
R,t),
(13)
I = Ψref([Irgb, Ifeature, Inorm
depth]),
(14)
The rendered depth image is standardised for Ψref by ap-
plying min–max normalisation, resulting in Inorm
depth.
3.4. Training and Losses
Given the GRMM representation, our proposed model is
learned end-to-end using multi-view image supervision to
train the decoders and refinement network. For this, we op-
timise the following objective function:
L = Lrec(I, I∗) + Lrec(Irgb, I∗) +
λdepth · Ldepth(Idepth, Igt
depth) + Lreg .
(15)
Here, I∗denotes the ground-truth RGB image. Lrec is the
reconstruction loss computed between both the image-space
prediction I from refinement network and the rendered im-
age Irgb against I∗. Ldepth is the L2 loss between the pre-
dicted and ground-truth depth images, scaled by the weight
λdepth.
Finally, Lreg represents additional regularization
terms applied during training. Specifically, image recon-
struction loss:
Lrec = λl1Ll1 + λssimLssim + λpercLperc
(16)
consists of L1 loss Ll1, SSIM loss Lssim, and perceptual loss
Lperc with the VGG [33] as the backbone. Meanwhile, the
training regularization loss:
Lreg = λsLs + λzLz + λlapLlap,
(17)
Here, Ls is a regularisation term on the scale parameters,
which encourages the scale of Gaussian primitives s to stay
within a constrained range as follows:
Ls = mean(ls), ls =





1/ max(si,d, 10−7)
if si,d < 0.1
(si,d −10.0)2
if si,d > 10.0
0
otherwise,
(18)
where si,d, d ∈{x, y, z} denotes the scale value of each
Gaussian primitive i along each axis, and mean(·) is the
average operation across all dimensions, similar to [31].
Llap represents a smoothness regularization term for the de-
formed mesh Md, and Lz is the L2-norm of zid and zexp to
improve the disentanglement.
In our experiments, we set λl1 = 0.8, λssim = 0.2,
λperc = 0.04, λz = 0.001, λlap = 0.01, λs = 0.1 and
λdepth = 0.5.
3.5. Fitting via Inverse Rendering
Given a single- or multi-view RGB portrait, we obtain 3D
face tracking with VHAP and align inputs (Sec. 3.1). We
use a two-stage optimisation.
Stage 1 (latent inversion). With decoders fixed, we op-
timise the latent codes zid and zexp by minimising
L(1)
fit = Lrec(I, I∗) + Lrec(Irgb, I∗) + λz Lz.
(19)
Stage 2 (prior-preserving refinement). We then fix zid
and zexp and fine-tune DGRMM for by minimising
L(2)
fit = Lrec(I, I∗) + Lrec(Irgb, I∗) + λloc Lloc.
(20)
Lloc is a PTI [30]-inspired locality regulariser that con-
strains updates to a small neighbourhood of the pretrained
solution, preserving the prior. We set λloc = 0.1. We de-
fine and ablate Lloc in detail in the supplementary material
(Section 9).
4. Experiments
We evaluate GRMM on the RAVDESS [22] dataset for
monocular 3D face reconstruction, using 10 randomly se-
lected identities. To assess novel-view synthesis across di-
verse expressions, we further sample ten identities from
NeRSemble [19], five from RenderMe, and three from
EXPRESS-50. RAVDESS provides monocular RGB videos
with acted emotions, while NeRSemble contributes multi-
view recordings that capture complex expressions and
head motion.
We report ablation studies in Section 4.1,
and present results on downstream applications including
monocular fitting, novel-view synthesis, and expression

Combining Datasets.
We conduct an ablation study to
assess the impact of combining EXPRESS-50 and Ren-

Using camera views as input, we fit our model
to target identities from NeRSemble.

improves identity and expression fidelity, highlighting the

4.2. Comparisons and Application
In this section, we demonstrate applications of GRMM in
monocular image fitting, novel-view synthesis, and expres-
sion transfer. These applications showcase the generalisa-
tion capacity of our model to unseen identities, expressions
and views.
Compared Methods.
We compare GRMM with pub-
licly available parametric head models, including Head-
NeRF [14], MoFaNeRF [52], and the recent Morphable Dif-
fusion [6]. We observe that Morphable Diffusion is not a
volume-rendering approach and achieves viewpoint control
via a conditioning camera. Consequently, it does not gen-
eralise well to camera distributions from unseen datasets;
when rendering novel viewpoints using evaluation dataset
cameras, the results appear misaligned and slightly dis-
torted.
Therefore, we do not report quantitative metrics
for Morphable Diffusion, but instead assess its performance
through a user study and qualitative analysis. The user study
evaluates novel view, expression and identity consistency,
with full details and results provided in the supplementary
material (Section 8).
Novel-view Synthesis.
We evaluate GRMM for the task
of novel-view synthesis for different identities in our eval-
uation set. We fit our model to a single viewpoint as de-

Figure 6. Expression transfer. From a single frontal image, we
invert (Sec. 3.5), swap expression parameters, and render novel
views on EXPRESS-50 and NeRSemble. GRMM preserves iden-
tity and subtle expressions with multi-view consistency, whereas
Morphable Diffusion (MD) generates inconsistent expressions
across views. Please zoom in for details.
Expression Transfer.
We compare GRMM to Morphable
Diffusion for expression transfer by randomly sampling tar-
get expressions for selected identities from EXPRESS-50
and NeRSemble. For each identity, we perform inversion
(Section 3.5) on a single frontal view, swap the expression
parameters, and render the results under novel views. Quali-
tatively, Morphable Diffusion struggles to capture subtle ex-
pressions and produces expression-inconsistent renderings
across novel views, whereas GRMM preserves both iden-
tity and expressions with multi-view consistency at high
resolution and real-time frame rates (see Figure 6 and the
supplemental video). A user study (Section 8) corroborates
these findings: participants consistently preferred GRMM
for both expression accuracy and identity preservation in
side-by-side novel-view comparisons.
4.3. Conclusion
We present GRMM, a Gaussian Residual Morphable Model
that addresses key limitations of existing 3D morphable
head models. By combining the efficiency of 3D Gaus-
sian Splatting with residual augmentation of a mesh-based
3DMM in a coarse-to-fine pipeline, GRMM achieves pho-
torealistic and diverse facial expressions at 1K resolu-
tion in real time (75 fps).
The model leverages UV-
anchored Gaussians and a lightweight refinement stage
to enhance rendering quality, speed, and controllable ex-
pressivity. We also introduce EXPRESS-50, a multi-view
dataset with 50 identities and 60 semantically aligned ex-
pressions, and show that joint training with RenderMe-
360 improves both identity generalisation and expression
fidelity.
While advancing the state of the art, GRMM
remains challenged by out-of-distribution subjects and
lighting variations, suggesting the need for more diverse
training data to improve robustness.
With its ability to
capture exaggerated expressions and render interactively,
GRMM is well-suited for applications in computer graph-
ics, virtual and augmented reality, and facial animation.

GRMM: Real-Time High-Fidelity Gaussian Morphable Head Model
with Learned Residuals
Supplementary Material
5. Dataset Details
We utilise two datasets for training: EXPRESS-50 and
RenderMe-360, each offering distinct advantages in terms
of expression coverage, identity diversity, and multi-view
supervision.
Their combination enables robust learning
of geometry, appearance, and expression disentanglement.
EXPRESS-50 is a multi-view dataset containing 50 subjects
(29 male, 21 female), each performing 60 aligned expres-
sions. Expressions are matched across all identities, en-
abling consistent expression conditioning during training.
Subjects span ages 23–40 (mean: 28), with the age and gen-
der distribution shown in Figure 7.
Figure 7. Statistics of the participants in our dataset.
Figure 8 shows different identities under a shared neutral
expression, while Figure 9 illustrates variation and consis-
tency across 10 aligned expressions for five sampled sub-
jects.
We select 280 identities from RenderMe-360 after filter-
ing, each performing 12 semantically matched expressions
under dense 360° multi-view capture. While it has fewer
expressions per subject than EXPRESS-50, its rich identity
and view coverage support generalisation across head poses
and appearances. Example of aligned expressions from this
dataset are shown in Figure 10.
6. Depth Supervision with ProbeSDF
To supervise geometry, we leverage ground-truth depth
maps Igt
depth generated with ProbeSDF [37]. These depth
images are spatially aligned with the corresponding input
RGB views, enabling us to directly measure consistency be-
tween the reconstructed geometry and the reference depth.
As shown in Figure 11, ProbeSDF provides smooth and
consistent depth for learning geometry.
Figure 8. Examples of 25 distinct identities from the EXPRESS-50
dataset, each aligned to the same neutral expression. This snapshot
represents a subset of the 50 identities available in the dataset.
7. Mesh and UV Enhancement
Without explicit mouth–interior geometry, the model ex-
ploits a shortcut: Mouth interior geometry and appear-
ance is implicitly encoded in the expression residual zexp,
entangling expression and intra-oral appearance (see Fig-
ure 13). Qualitatively, when we zero out the expression
residual code zexp the mouth interior becomes severely
distorted, indicating that tooth and tongue detail is stored
in the expression channel rather than in identity residuals
zid. To improve geometric expressiveness and enable de-
tailed modeling of the mouth interior, we extend the origi-
nal FLAME [20] mesh topology by adding vertex sets for
the upper and lower teeth, similar to VHAP [28], along with
a face for the inner mouth cavity. This modification mod-
estly increases the vertex count while preserving FLAME’s
semantic structure. To support Gaussian parameter predic-
tion in these new regions, we augment the UV map to cover
the extended topology. The resulting UV layout includes
the mouth interior, allowing convolutional decoders to as-
sign meaningful color, opacity, and feature values to mouth-
interior Gaussians. Figure 12 illustrates the enhanced UV

8. User study
We conducted a user study to qualitatively assess how well
GRMM and Morphable Diffusion preserve (i) the reference
person’s facial expression and (ii) identity. Each trial pre-
sented three images: a frontal reference (ground truth) on
the left and two novel-view renderings from the two meth-
ods, labeled A and B. For every example, participants an-
swered two questions: (1) which variant better preserves
the expression, and (2) which variant better preserves the
identity. Responses used five options: Strong preference for
A/B, Weak preference for A/B, and Equally preferred (tie).
The assignment of A and B to the underlying methods was
pre-specified and counterbalanced across examples to avoid
label bias. We collected responses from 20 participants,
each evaluating 15 examples (two judgments per example:
expression and identity), yielding 600 total judgments. As
summarized in Table 4, participants showed a clear over-
all preference for GRMM: 94.2% of judgments favored
GRMM (sum of strong and weak preferences), 4.5% fa-
vored Morphable Diffusion, and 1.3% were ties.

the pretrained solution for interpolations between the
fine-tuned subject and dataset identities.

We render two images using the same interpolated parame-
ters: Ifrozen with the pretrained frozen model, and Ituned
with the fine-tuned model. Our locality loss is then defined
as:
Lloc = Lrec(Ituned, Ifrozen),
where Lrec is the image-space reconstruction loss defined
in Sec. 3.4. This encourages the refined model to preserve
the behaviour of the pretrained prior (Figure 14) along in-
terpolation paths between known dataset identities and the
personalized subject, ensuring that refinements remain lo-
calized.

The locality loss preserves the prior and yields
sharper detail and fewer artifacts in novel views. PSNR (dB): With

Disabling Φmesh and learning only
fine residual offsets for the Gaussian primitives reduces
mouth and cheek articulation, which yields poorer facial ex-
pressivity and reduced photorealism, as shown in Figure 15.

Eliminating Ψref leads to de-
graded hair texture, loss of mouth details, and reduced over-
all sharpness and fidelity, as shown in Figure 16. This high-
lights the importance of screen-space correction, even after
rasterization.
11. Implementation details.
The model is trained for 250,000 iterations with a batch size
of 1 on four NVIDIA A100 GPUs. We use the Adam [18]
optimizer with a learning rate of 1 × 10−4 for all learnable
parameters.

Disentangled control.
We demonstrate disentangled con-
trol over 3DMM and residual parameters; see Figure 17.
13. Limitations and Future Work
While significantly advancing the state of the art, our model
is not without limitations. One notable limitation of the
method lies in its difficulty in handling out-of-distribution
subjects, such as individuals with long hair or unconven-
tional facial features, which may deviate significantly from
the training data. Additionally, variations in the lighting en-
vironment can challenge the model’s robustness, potentially
leading to artefacts or inaccuracies in rendering. These is-
sues underscore the need to enhance the generalizability of

<!-- page 15 -->
the approach. A promising direction to address this limita-
tion involves annotating a more diverse set of identities with
a wide range of expressions and lighting variations, ensur-
ing that the model can better accommodate subjects with
varying appearances and environmental conditions, thereby
enhancing the method’s ability to generalise to more chal-
lenging real-world scenarios.
